<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<h2 class="top">Passive Abilities</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="ImprovedPreciseShot">	Improved Precise Shot</dt>
	<dd>				Your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.</dd>

	<dt id="PreciseMinstrel">	Precise Minstrel (Ex)<dt/>
	<dd>				You gain Precise Shot as a bonus feat. In addition, any creature that is affected by any of your bardic performance does not provide soft cover to enemies against your ranged attacks with a bow.</dd>

	<dt id="PreciseShot">		Precise Shot</dt>
	<dd>				You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard &minus;4 penalty on your attack roll.</dd>
</dl>




<h2>Swift Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="ArcaneStrike">		Arcane Strike</dt>
	<dd>				For 1 round, your weapons deal +1 damage and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This bonus increases by +1 for every five caster levels you possess, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="ArrowsongStrike">	Arrowsong Strike (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				Whenever you cast a single-target ranged touch attack spell, you you can deliver the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a ranged attack.  Instead of the free ranged touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, you can make one free ranged attack with your weapon (at your highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell.  If successful, this ranged attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell.  This attack uses the weapon&rsquo;s critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the <i>keen</i> weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals &times;2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.  Even if the spell can normally affect multiple targets, only a single missile, ray, or effect accompanies the attack. At 18th level, you can use a multiple-target spell with this ability to deliver one ray or line of effect with each attack when using a full-attack action, up to the maximum allowed by the spell (in the case of ray effects). Any effects not used in the round the spell is cast are lost.</dd>

	<dt id="DeadlyAim">		Deadly Aim</dt>
	<dd>				You can choose to take a &minus;1 penalty on all ranged attack rolls to gain a +2 bonus on all ranged damage rolls. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every +4 thereafter, the penalty increases by &minus;1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.</dd>

	<dt id="ManyShot">		Many Shot</dt>
	<dd>				When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires two arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as your favored enemy bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each arrow.</dd>

	<dt id="PointBlankShot">	Point-Blank Shot</dt>
	<dd>				You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.</dd>

	<dt id="RapidShot">		Rapid Shot</dt>
	<dd>				You can make one extra attack per round with a missile weapon at your highest attack bonus, but all attacks made in this round suffer a &minus;2 penalty.  You must use a full attack to use this option.</dd>
</dl>






<h1>Bardic Performance</h1>
<hr class="big">
You can use performances to create magical effects on those around you, including yourself if desired.  You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + your Charisma modifier, plus an additional 2 rounds per day for each bard level after 1st.  Each round, you can produce any one bardic performance that you have mastered.  Starting a bardic performance is a move or swift action; a performance can be maintained as a free action.  Changing a performance from one effect to another requires you to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a move or swift action.  A performance cannot be disrupted, but ends immediately if you are killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. You cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.

<p>
If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear you for the performance to have any effect, and such performances are language dependent. If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to you for the performance to have any effect.  A deaf bard has a 20% change to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component, and a blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with visual components. If you fail this check, the attempt still counts against your daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components, and blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components..

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Your available bardic performances are:
<dl>
	<dt id="Countersong">		Countersong (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You may make a Perform (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check.  Any creature within 30 feet (including you) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher.  If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the Perform skill check result for the save.  Countersong does not work on effects that don&rsquo;t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.</dd>

	<dt id="InspireCourage">	Inspire Courage (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You use dance to inspire courage in your allies (including yourself). To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive your performance.  Each ally affected receives a +3 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +3 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. Inspire courage can use audible or visual components. You must choose which component to use when starting the performance.</dd>
	
	<dt id="InspireGreatness">	Inspire Greatness (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use performance to inspire greatness in two willing allies within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. Those affected gain 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply their Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.</dd>

	<dt id="FrighteningTune">	Frightening Tune (Sp)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use your performance to cause fear in your enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear you perform and be within 30 feet. Each enemy within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + &frac12; your level + your Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save fails, the target becomes frightened and flees for as long as the target can hear your performance. Frightening tune relies on audible components.</dd>

	<dt id="InspireHeroics">	Inspire Heroics (Su):</dt>
	<dd>				You can inspire heroism in yourself or a single ally within 30 feet.  For every three bard levels you attain beyond 15th, you can inspire heroics in an additional creature. To inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and hear you. Inspired creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. This effect lasts for as long as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and visual components.</dd>
</dl>




<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="ArcaneArchery">		Arcane Archery:</dt>
	<dd>				You added 3 sorcerer/wizard spells to your bard class spell list at 1st level, and one more each at 4th level and every 4 bard levels thereafter.  These spells are limited to <i>acid arrow</i>, <i>arrow eruption</i>, <i>flame arrow</i>, <i>gravity bow</i>, <i>greater magic weapon</i>, <i>longshot</i>, <i>magic weapon</i>, <i>protection from arrows</i>, <i>spectral hand</i>, <i>true strike</i>, and sorcerer/wizard spells of the evocation school.  You have selected <i>fire snake</i>, <i>flame arrow</i>, <i>gravity bow</i>, <i>lightning arc</i>, <i>ricochet shot</i>, and <i>snowball</i>.  In addition, for the purpose of meeting the requirements of combat feats and prestige classes, you treat your bard level as your base attack bonus.  You may also fulfull a spell&rsquo;s somatic components even when using a bow in both hands.</dd>

	<dt id="DiscordantVoice">	Discordant Voice:</dt>
	<dd>				Whenever you are using bardic performance to create a spell-like or supernatural effect, allies within 30 feet of you deal an extra 1d6 points of sonic damage with successful weapon attacks. This damage stacks with other energy damage a weapon might deal. Projectile weapons bestow this extra damage on their ammunition, but the extra damage is dealt only if the projectile hits a target within 30 feet of you.</dd>

	<dt id="ElfBlood">		Elf Blood</dt>
	<dd>				You count as both elf and human for any effect related to race.</dd>

	<dt id="JackOfAllTrades">	Jack of All Trades (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use any skill, even if the skill normally requires you to be trained.</dd>

	<dt id="KindredRaised">		Kindred Raised</dt>
	<dd>				You gained a +2 bonus to Charisma and Dexterity.</dd>

	<dt id="MartialPerformance">	Martial Performance</dt>
	<dd>				You gained Weapon Focus in longbow, and your effective fighter level is equal to &frac12; your bard level for the purpose of qualifying for feats that specifically select weapons from the axes and bows fighter weapon groups.</dd>

	<dt id="VersatilePerformance">	Versatile Performance (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use your bonus for your Perform (dance skill) in place of your bonus for Acrobatics and Fly, and your Perform (stringed instruments) in place of your bonus in Bluff and Diplomacy.  At level 18 you will an additional type of Performance to substitute.</dd>
</dl>



<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="Bow">			<i>Adaptive Composite Longbow +5</i></dt>
	<dd>				This composite longbow has a +5 enhancement bonus.  Additionally, the bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder&rsquo;s Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired.</dd>

	<dt id="Armor">			<i>Celestial Armor</i></dt>
	<dd>				This <i>+3 chainmail</i> is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of &minus;2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor and allows the wearer to use <a href="Spellbook.htm#Fly" target="_blank"><i>fly</i></a> on command once per day.</dd>

	<dt id="CircletOfPersuasion">	<i>Circlet of Persuasion</i>
	<dd>				This delicately engraved silver headband grants its wearer a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks.

	<dt id="Belt">			<i>Elbree&rsquo;s Belt</i></dt>
	<dd>				This belt provides a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution.</dd>

	<dt id="Headband">		<i>Elbree&rsquo;s Headband</i></dt>
	<dd>				This headband provides a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma and a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom.</dd>

	<dt id="HandyHaversack">	<i>Handy Haversack</i></dt>
	<dd>				A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.</dd>

	<dt id="RingOfSpellKnowledge">	<i>Ring of Spell Knowledge</i></dt>
	<dd>				Through study, the wearer of this ring can gain the knowledge of a single 1st -or 2nd-level spell in addition to those allotted by her class and level. The wearer must still encounter a written, active, or cast version of the spell and succeed at a DC 20 Spellcraft check to teach the spell to the ring. Thereafter, the arcane spellcaster may cast the spell as though she knew the spell and it appeared on her class spell list.  Arcane spells that do not appear on the wearer&rsquo;s class list are treated as one level higher for all purposes (storage and casting). Currently, the ring stores <i>shield.</i></dd>

	<dt id="Sword">			<i>Agile Training Short Sword +1</i></dt>
	<dd>				This <i>+1 short sword</i> grants the Weapon Finesse feat to the wielder as long as the weapon is drawn and in hand. That feat cannot be used as a prerequisite for any other feats and functions for you only if you meet its prerequisites. Once chosen, the feat stored in the weapon cannot be changed.  The sword also permits you to apply your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls in place of your Strength modifier.</dd>

	<dt id="TunedBowstring">	<i>Tuned Bowstring</i></dt>
	<dd>				This faintly glowing bowstring is twined from the hair of a lillend. When strung on a bow, a tuned bowstring also functions as a masterwork stringed instrument, granting the wielder an enhancement bonus on Performance (string) checks equal to the bow&rsquo;s enhancement bonus (if any). A tuned bowstring produces a perfect note with every arrow fired by its wielder, allowing a character with the bardic performance class feature to maintain a performance in combat without expending rounds of bardic performance as long as she fires at least one arrow each round. Activating a bardic performance or switching to a different performance still costs a round of bardic performance.</dd>
