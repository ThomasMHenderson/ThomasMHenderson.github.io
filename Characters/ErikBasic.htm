<h4>Physical Description</h4>
Erik stands just over 6&rsquo; tall, wearing an impressively shined set of full plate. This plate looks impeccable. About his shoulders is a blood-red cloak, with the symbol of Iomedae embroided on the back of it. Wearing a blood-red elven-made tabard, with gold thread inlay of the Symbol of Iomedae covers the breastplate and torso of Erik. A large, well-worked bow is slung across his back, beneath a well polished, but inexplicalby plain steel shield. Along his side is a longsword with a more-function than looks hilt, but looks extremely well made. His silver hair flows from beneath his open faced-helmet (think gladiator/roman) With a short blood-red plume adorning the top of the helmet. From within the helmet, Erik stares with fierce blue eyes. His eyes are surrounded with a strange glow of golden light. As well as his entire body seems to glow, with varying intensity.



<h4>Personality Profile</h4>
Fanatical in his devotion to Iomedae.





<h4>Background</h4>
Erik was orphaned at birth, lived on the streets as a young child, and was taken in by the Church of Iomedae at the age of 7.  From that point on, he was raised a holy warrior, equal parts martial combat and religous devotion, Erik spent his pre-teens and teens devoting every waking moment into the Divine.  Seeing as Erik's parents are lost (or more correctly, unknown), Erik has no clue about his true parents, or siblings. He does however know, with the help of a Church Elder, that his parentage links back to the Archon, Raziel.  This knowledge is not widely available to the church at large, but several such rumors have sprung up over the years.
