<h4>Notes</h4>
Glim is a short, swarthy gnome, with facial hair and mouth like what you would see on the old-time "wolf-people" of Mexico or Latin America.  In addition to his overactive hair growth and protruding teeth, Glim also suffers from a pronounced harelip, making his speech difficult to understand at best.  Glim was frequently frustrated as a youth with his inability to be understood, but eventually he came to see it as his own special language.  Since so many of his folk shunned him as cursed with lycanthropy (though he was not actually a werewolf), he eventually decided to embrace the moon as she was ever watchful, ever in his view.  Through his travels he came across a curious wolf-pup that he slowly tamed and called Tim.  The two now adventure together as an inseparable pair.  Tim doesn't really understand Glim's frequent ramblings, but he understands the meanings and tones.  When under duress or frustrated, Glim will curse a litany of foul-mouthed expletives, though usually no one understands a word of it, which is probably for the best.  He has become somewhat of a master at disrupting the castings of others, taking delight and cackling with glee at the faces of the spellcasters brought down by their hubris and his cunning.
