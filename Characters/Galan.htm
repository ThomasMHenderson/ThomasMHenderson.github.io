<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<h2 class="top">Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="PowerAttack">		Power Attack</dt>
	<dd>				You can choose to take a &minus;1 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +2 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased by half (+50%) if you are making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using two hands, or a primary natural weapon that adds 1&ndash;1/2 times your Strength modifier on damage rolls. This bonus to damage is halved (&minus;50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, the penalty increases by &minus;1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.</dd>

	<dt id="RapidAttack">		Rapid Attack (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You can combine a full attack action with a single move. You must forgo the attack at your highest bonus but may take the remaining attacks at any point during your movement. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</dd>
</dl>




<h2>Attacks of Opportunity</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="Bodyguard">		Bodyguard</dt>
	<dd>				When an adjacent ally is attacked, you may use an attack of opportunity to attempt the aid another action to improve your ally&rsquo;s AC. You may not use the aid another action to improve your ally&rsquo;s attack roll with this attack.</dd>
</dl>




<h2>Immediate Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="InHarmsWay">		In Harm&rsquo;s Way</dt>
	<dd>				While using the aid another action to improve an adjacent ally&rsquo;s AC, you can intercept a successful attack against that ally as an immediate action, taking full damage from that attack and any associated effects (bleed, poison, etc.). A creature cannot benefit from this feat more than once per attack.</dd>

	<dt id="SavingShield">		Saving Shield</dt>
	<dd>				Whenever an adjacent ally is the target of an attack, you can, as an immediate action, grant that adjacent ally a +2 shield bonus to AC. You must be wielding a light shield, heavy shield, or tower shield to use this feat.  You add &frac12; of your shield&rsquo;s enhancement bonus to the shield bonus to AC that you grant.</dd>
</dl>




<h2>Standard Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="TakeCover">		Take Cover</dt>
	<dd>				You can use your <i>darkwood tower shield +5</i> to grant yourself total cover on one edge of your square, though the shield does not provide cover against targeted spells.</dd>
</dl>




<h2>Full-Round Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="CombatPatrol">		Combat Patrol</dt>
	<dd>				As a full-round action, you may set up a combat patrol, increasing your threatened area by 5 feet for every 5 points of your base attack bonus. Until the beginning of your next turn, you may make attacks of opportunity against any opponent in this threatened area that provokes attacks of opportunity. You may move as part of these attacks, provided your total movement before your next turn does not exceed your speed. Any movement you make provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</dd>
</dl>




<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="Agility">		Agility (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws made against effects that cause you to become paralyzed, slowed, or entangled. This bonus increases to +5 at level 18.</dd>

	<dt id="ArmorExpert">		Armor Expert</dt>
	<dd>				When you wear armor of any sort, reduce that suit&rsquo;s armor check penalty by 1, to a minimum check penalty of 0.</dd>

	<dt id="ArmorTraining">		Armor Training (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You reduce the armor check penalty of armor you wear by 2 (to a minimum of 0) and increase the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by your armor by 2.</dd>

	<dt id="CombatReflexes">	Combat Reflexes</dt>
	<dd>				You may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to your Dexterity bonus. You may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.</dd>

	<dt id="CoveringShield">	Covering Shield</dt>
	<dd>				While using a tower shield, you gain a bonus on Reflex saves against area of effect attacks equal to your shield&rsquo;s base bonus to armor class plus any bonuses granted by feats or class abilities. This does not transfer any enhancement bonuses on a shield to Reflex saves.</dd>

	<dt id="DefensiveTraining">	Defensive Training</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC against monsters of the giant subtype.</dd>

	<dt id="FleetFooted">		Fleet Footed (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				Your base speed increases by 10&rsquo;.  You can take 10 on Acrobatics checks even while distracted or threatened, and can take 20 on an Acrobatics check once per day for every five fighter levels you possess.</dd>

	<dt id="Greed">			Greed</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks made to determine the price of nonmagical goods that contain precious metals or gemstones.</dd>

	<dt id="Hardy">			Hardy</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison and (due in part to your Steel Soul feat) a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against spells, and spell-like abilities.</dd>

	<dt id="Hatred">		Hatred</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the orc and goblinoid subtypes.</dd>

	<dt id="LeapingAttack">		Leaping Attack (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				When you move at least 5 feet prior to attacking, you gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</dd>

	<dt id="MissileShield">		Missile Shield</dt>
	<dd>				Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon (not including spell effects, natural attacks, or massive ranged weapons), you may deflect it so that you take no damage, as if you had the Deflect Arrows feat. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.  You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to use this feat.</dd>

	<dt id="SlowAndSteady">		Slow and Steady</dt>
	<dd>				Your speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance.</dd>

	<dt id="Stability">		Stability</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +4 racial bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground.</dd>

	<dt id="Stonecunning">		Stonecunning</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice unusual stonework, such as traps and hidden doors located in stone walls or floors, and receive a check to notice such features whenever you pass within 10 feet of them, whether or not you are actively looking.</dd>

	<dt id="TunnelFighter">		Tunnel Fighter</dt>
	<dd>				While underground, you receive a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks and a +1 trait bonus on weapon damage rolls for critical hits (this damage is multiplied on a critical hit).</dd>

	<dt id="VanguardStyleAll">	Vanguard Style</dt>
	<dd>				As a swift action while in combat, you can enter the Vanguard Stance.  The stance persists until either you use a swift action to switch styles or until the end of the combat encounter, whichever occurs first.  While in the Vanguard Stance, you gain the following benefits:
		<dl class="options">
			<dt id="VanguardStyle">		Vanguard Style</dt>
			<dd>				When an adjacent ally is required to make a Reflex saving throw, you can expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt the aid another action to improve your ally&rsquo;s Reflex save. Your ally gains a +2 bonus to all Reflex saves while adjacent to you until the beginning of your next turn.</dd>

			<dt id="VanguardWard">		Vanguard Ward</dt>
			<dd>				When an adjacent ally is attacked or required to make a Reflex saving throw, you can expend a use of an attack of opportunity to use both Bodyguard and Vanguard Style to protect that ally. You can also lose your shield bonus to AC to grant your ally a shield bonus to AC of the same value for as long as that ally gains a bonus to Reflex saves from Vanguard Style.</dd>

			<dt id="VanguardHustle">	Vanguard Hustle</dt>
			<dd>				Whenever you increase your threatened area with Combat Patrol, your ward retains the bonuses of Vanguard Style as long as he remains within your threatened area, and you can use Bodyguard, Saving Shield, and Vanguard Style whenever an ally that is within this threatened area is the target of an attack.</dt>
		</dl></dd>
</dl>




<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="BootsStridingSpringing">	<i>Boots of Striding and Springing</i></dt>
	<dd>					These boots increase the wearer&rsquo;s base land speed by 10 feet. In addition to this striding ability (considered an enhancement bonus), these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. He can jump with a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks.</dd>

	<dt id="TowerShield">			<i>Folding Darkwood Tower Shield +5</i></dt>
	<dd>					This shield provides a +11 shield bonus to armor class.  It has an armor check penalty of &minus;7 and limits your Dexterity bonus to armor class to +2.  While using it, you take a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls.  As a standard action, you can choose one edge of your space and gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge, though targeted spells can still target you.  On command, as a move action, while you are wearing the shield, it can change into a buckler, a heavy shield, or a tower shield.</dd>

	<dt id="RicochetHammer">		<i>Ricochet Hammer +5</i></dt>
	<dd>					This <i>+5 returning light hammer</i> can strike multiple foes with a single throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first target to strike at a second target, and so on for each of the wielder&rsquo;s additional attacks. The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a &minus;4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the <i>returning</i> property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as <i>true strike</i>) only apply to the first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder&rsquo;s additional attacks for that round.</dd>

	<dt id="SoulsightGoggles">		<i>Soulsight Goggles</i></dt>
	<dd>					This set of goggles is engraved with geometric patterns and arcane runes. The wearer can immediately see and discern magical auras within 60 feet, as <a href="Spellbook.htm#arcanesight"><i>arcane sight</i></a>. In addition, the wearer is more clearly able to see the animating forces of incorporeal creatures and can therefore harm incorporeal creatures with nonmagical attacks, though these attacks deal only half damage. If the wearer uses a magic weapon to attack an incorporeal creature, the attack deals full damage instead. The goggles have no effect on attacks made with <i>ghost touch</i> weapons.  Once per day on command, the wearer can amplify the goggles&rsquo; ability to sense animating forces for 1 hour. This amplification allows the wearer the ability to notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 30 feet, just as if she had a psychopomp&rsquo;s spiritsense ability . The goggles do not grant the wearer the ability to discern magical auras while amplified.</dd>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<hr class="big">
<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Just to make sure we&rsquo;re on the same page, here&rsquo;s a list of your abilities to defend your allies:
</p>
<dl class="options" style="margin-top:0">
	<dt>	Bodyguard</dt>
	<dd>	When an adjacent ally is attacked, you can use an AoO to give them a +2 bonus to AC against that attack.  If the attack hits anyway, you can use In Harm&rsquo;s Way as an immediate action to take the damage from the attack.</dd>

	<dt>	Saving Shield</dt>
	<dd>	When an adjacent ally is attacked, you can use an immediate action to give them a +4 shield bonus to AC.</dd>

	<dt>	Vanguard Style</dt>
	<dd>	This has several benefits usable while in the appropriate stance:
		<ul>
			<li>	When an adjacent ally is attacked or has to roll a Reflex save, you can use an AoO to give them a +2 bonus to AC against the next attack and a +2 bonus on Reflex saves until the beginning of your next turn, so long as the ally remains adjacent to you.</li>
			<li>	You can choose to apply your shield&rsquo;s bonus to AC to your warded ally instead of to yourself.</li>
			<li>	If you are also in a Combat Patrol, you can use your Bodyguard, In Harm&rsquo;s Way, and Vanguard Style abilities to help any ally in your threatened area, and a warded ally retains the bonuses from Vanguard Style so long as they stay within your threatened area.  You have to move up to be adjacent to the ally, using the movement provided by Combat Patrol.</li>
		</ul></dd>
