<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<h2 class="top">Swift Action</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="Fervor">	Fervor (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			You can draw upon the power of your faith a number of times per day equal to &frac12; your warpriest level (round down) + your Wisdom modifier.

<p>By expending one use of this ability, you can heal yourself of 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 3 warpriest levels you possess above 2nd.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">As a swift action, you can expend one use of this ability to cast any one warpriest spell you have prepared with a casting time of 1 round or less.  When cast in this way, the spell can target only yourself, even if it could normally target other or multiple targets.  Spells cast in this way ignore somatic components and do not provoke attacks of opportunity.  You do not need to have a free hand to cast a spell in this way.</p></dd>


	<dt id="LayOnHands">	Lay On Hands (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			You can heal wounds (your own or those of others) by touch.  With one use of this ability, you can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels you possess.  Alternatively, you can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels you possess.  Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.  Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.

<p>Using this ability is a standard action, unless you target yourself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, you only need one free hand to use this ability.  You can lay on hands a number of times per day equal to &frac12; your paladin level plus your Charisma modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">Whenever you lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies you possess. A mercy can remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison without curing the affliction. Such conditions return after 1 hour unless the mercy actually removes the affliction that causes the condition.  Currently, your mercies heal sickened.</p></dd>


	<dt id="SacredArmor">	Sacred Armor (Su)
	<dd>			You can enhance your armor with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level).  These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5.  You can use this ability a number of minutes per day equal to your warpriest level. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments, but they don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive.  The enhancement bonus and armor special abilities (see below) are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the next day.  These bonuses apply only while you are wearing the armor, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves your possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of your turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield.  When you use this ability, you can also use your <a href="#SacredWeapon">sacred weapon</a> ability as a free action by expending one use of fervor.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">You can enhance your armor tohave any of the following special abilities: <i>energy resistance</i> (normal, improved, and greater), <i>fortification</i> (heavy, light, or moderate), <i>glamered</i>, and <i>spell resistance</i> (13, 15, 17, and 19).  Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability&rsquo;s base cost.  Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other special abilities can be added.</p>
	<dl class="options">
		<dt>	Energy Resistance</dt>
		<dd>	The armor protects against one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic).  It absorbs the first 10 (normal), 20 (improved) or 30 (greater) points of energy damage per attack (similar to the <a href="Spellbook.htm#resist_energy" target="_blank"><i>resist energy</i></a> spell).  Price: +2 bonus (normal), +4 bonus (improved), or +5 bonus (greater).</dd>

		<dt>	Fortification</dt>
		<dd>	The armor produces a magical force that protects your vital areas more effecitvely.  When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. The chance is 25% for <i>light fortification</i>, 50% for <i>moderate fortification</i>, and 75% for <i>heavy fortification</i>.  Price: +1 bonus (light), +3 bonus (moderate), or +5 bonus (heavy).</dd>

		<dt>	Glamered</dt>
		<dd>	Upon command, the armor changes shape and appearance to assume the form of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when it is so disguised. Only a <i>true seeing</i> spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when it is disguised.  Price: +1 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Spell Resistance</dt>
		<dd>	The armor grants you spell resistance while the armor is worn.  Price: +2 bonus (13), +3 bonus (15), +4 bonus (17), or +5 bonus (19).</dd>
	</dl></dd>


	<dt id="SacredWeapon">	Sacred Weapon (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			Iomedae&rsquo;s favored weapon and any weapons for which you have the weapon focus feat are sacred weapons.  The damage you do with these weapons is based on your warpriest level, not on the weapon&rsquo;s normal damage if this would increase the damage above that the weapon normally does.</p>

<p>You can enhance one of your sacred weapons with divine power as a swift action.  This ability grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5.  If you have more than one sacred weapon, you can enhance another on the following round by using another swift action.  You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your warpriest level, but these rounds don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive.  If multiple weapons are enhanced, each one consumes rounds of use individually. The enhancement bonus and special abilities (see below) are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the next day. These benefits do not apply if another creature is wielding the weapon, but they continue to be in effect if the weapon otherwise leaves your possession (such as if the weapon is thrown). This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of your turn (that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed during the same round). If you use this ability on a double weapon, the effects apply to only one end of the weapon.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">You can enhance a weapon to have any of the following special abilities: <i>axiomatic</i>, <i>brilliant energy</i>, <i>defending</i>, <i>disruption</i>, <i>flaming</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>ghost touch</i>, <i>holy</i>, <i>keen</i>, <i>merciful</i> or <i>shock</i>.  Adding any of these special abilities consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the special ability&rsquo;s base price modifier. Duplicate special abilities don&rsquo;t stack. The weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any special abilities can be added.</p>
	<dl class="options">
		<dt>	Axiomatic</dt>
		<dd>	Your weapon is lawful-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against chaotic creatures.  Price: +2 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Brilliant Energy</dt>
		<dd>	A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter.  Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor.  Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.  A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects.  This property can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons, and ammunition.  Price: +4 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Defending</dt>
		<dd>	A defending weapon allows you to transfer some or all of the weapon&rsquo;s enhancement bonus to your AC as a bonus that stacks with all others.  As a free action, you chooses how to allocate the weapon&rsquo;s enhancement bonus at the start of your turn before using the weapon, and the bonus to AC lasts until your next turn.  Price: +1 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Disruption</dt>
		<dd>	Any undead creature struck in combat must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be destroyed.  Price: +2 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Flaming</dt>
		<dd>	The weapon is sheathed in fire that deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. The fire does not harm you.  Price: +1 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Frost</dt>
		<dd>	The weapon is sheathed in icy cold that deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit. The cold does not harm you.  Price: +1 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Ghost Touch</dt>
		<dd>	Your weapon is deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus. An incorporeal creature&rsquo;s 50% reduction in damage from corporeal sources does not apply to attacks made against it with <i>ghost touch</i> weapons. The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a <i>ghost touch</i> weapon counts as both corporeal or incorporeal.  Price: +1 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Holy</dt>
		<dd>	Your weapon is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against evil creatures.  Price: +2 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Keen</dt>
		<dd>	This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or slashing melee weapons can be keen.  This benefit doesn&rsquo;t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.  Price: +1 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Merciful</dt>
		<dd>	The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, but all damage it deals is nonlethal damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until told to resume it (allowing it to deal lethal damage, but without any bonus damage from this ability).  Price: +1 bonus.</dd>

		<dt>	Shock</dt>
		<dd>	The weapon is sheathed in crackling electricity that deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit. The electricity does not harm you.  Price: +1 bonus.</dd>
	</dl></dd>


	<dt id="SmiteEvil">	Smite Evil (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			Three times per day, you can choose one target within sight to smite.  If this target is evil, you add your Cha bonus (if any) to your attack rolls and add your paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of the smite. If the target of smite evil is an undead creature, the bonus to damage on all attacks increases to 2 points of damage per paladin level you possess. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.

<p>In addition, while smite evil is in effect, you gain a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier (if any) to your AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If you target a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">You can use this ability once per day, plus once more at level 4 and at every three levels thereafter.  The effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time you rest and regain your uses of this ability.</p></dd>
</dl>



<h2>Standard Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="AlterSelf">	Alter Self (Sp)</dt>
	<dd>			Once per day, you can use <a href="Spellbook.htm#alter_self" target="_blank"><i>alter self</i></a> at a caster level equal to your character level.</dd>


	<dt id="Blessings">	Blessings (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			You can call upon Iomedae for blessings a total number of times per day equal to 3 + &frac12; your warpriest level.  You currently have access to the following blessings:
	<dl class="Options">
		<dt id="BattleCompanion">	Battle Companion</dt>
		<dd>				You can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <a href="Spellbook.htm#summon_monster_4" target="_blank"><i>summon monster IV</i></a> with a duration of 1 minute, but for only a good outsider or an animal with the celestial creature simple template. This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <i>summon monster</i> spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX</i> at 20th level).</dd>

		<dt id="BlindingStrike">	Blinding Strike</dt>
		<dd>				You can create a flash of sunlight in the eyes of one of your opponents within 30 feet. The target is blinded for 1 round. If it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw, it’s instead dazzled for 1 round. Creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity take a &minus;4 penalty on this saving throw. This is a light effect. Sightless creatures are unaffected by this ability.  The save DC is 10 + &frac12; your warpriest level + your Wisdom modifier.</dd>

		<dt id="CleansingFire">		Cleansing Fire</dt>
		<dd>				You can touch a weapon and grant it either the <i>flaming</i> or <i>undead-bane</i> weapon special ability for 1 minute. If you spend two uses of your blessing when activating this ability, the weapon can have both weapon special abilities.</dd>

		<dt id="HolyStrike">		Holy Strike</dt>
		<dd>				You can bless one weapon with the power of goodness with a touch.  For one minute, the weapon glows green, white, or yellow-gold and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against evil creatures.  During this time, the weapon is treated as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  This additional damage doesn&rsquo;t stack with the additional damage from the <i>holy</i> weapon special ability.</dt>
	</dl></dd>


	<dt id="ChannelEnergy">	Channel Energy (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			You can cause a burst of positive energy that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30&rsquo; radius centered on yourself, though you can choose to exclude yourself from the effect.

<p>In order to use this ability, you must either expend 2 uses of lay on hands or 2 uses of fervor.  This ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity and you must be able to present your holy symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">Living creatures are healed of 6d6 points of damage when you use lay on hands or fervor (increasing to 7d6 at warpriest level 14); undead instead take the same amount of damage, though they receive a Will save for &frac12; damage (DC = 10 + &frac12; paladin or warpriest level + Cha modifier).  Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total.</p>


	<dt id="DetectEvil">	Detect Evil (Sp)</dt>
	<dd>			At will, you can <a href="#Spellbook.htm#Detect Evil" target="_blank"><i>detect evil</i></a> as the spell.  As a move action, you can concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, you do not detect evil in any other object or individual within range.<dd>
</dl>



<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="AngelicBlood">			Angelic Blood</dt>
	<dd>					You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects with the evil descriptor and on Constitution checks to stabilize when you are reduced to negative hit points (but not dead).

If a feat requires choosing a weapon or weapon group, you must choose Iomedae&rsquo;s favored weapon, or its group. You must meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites, but treat your tempered champion levels as fighter levels for this purpose.  In addition, you gain the increased base weapon damage of the warpriest&rsquo;s sacred weapon ability at your tempered champion level.</dd>

	<dt id="WeaponTraining">		Weapon Training (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>					You select one group of weapons. Whenever you attack with a weapon from this group, you gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.  When you become trained in another group of weapons, you gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this new group, and the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</dd>
</dl>



<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="Bow">		<i>Adaptive Composite Longbow +1</i></dt>
	<dd>			This composite longbow has a +1 enhancement bonus. Additionally, the bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder’s Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired.</dd>

	<dt id="Bracers">	<i>Erik&rsquo;s Bracers</i></dt>
	<dd>			These silver bracers combine the effects of <i>bracers of the merciful knight</i> and a <i>silver smite bracelet</i>.  They glow with a soft white light when you pray.  You treat your paladin level as 4 higher than normal for the purpose of your lay on hands and smite evil class features.  This ability is already included above.  Once per day, you can infuse your lay on hands with additional power, providing relief as a <a href="Spellbook.htm#lesser_restoration" target="_blank"><i>lesser restoration</i></a> spell.</dd>

	<dt id="Bracers">	<i>Erik&rsquo;s Headband</i></dt>
	<dd>			This headband combines the effects of a <i>headband of mental prowess (Wis, Cha) +4</i> and a <i>phylactery of positive channeling.</i>  In its latter function, it allows channelers of positive energy to increase the amount of damage dealt to undead creatures by +2d6. This also increases the amount of damage healed by living creatures.  This bonus is included in your channel energy ability above.</dd>
