<h4>Physical Description</h4>
In most ways, Sabrae looks typically elven.
She is slender, graceful, and beautiful, with bright turquoise eyes, a heart-shaped face, and hip-length silver hair which she usually wears loose but ties back when traveling or adventuring.
Though she is both shorter and more solidly built than is typical for a surface elf, it is her dusky purple skin which most clearly marks her as drow.
Sabrae moves with characteristic elven grace and often seems to be on the point of dancing.
Her musical voice is a touch breathy and slightly throaty, with a pronounced elven accent.
She smiles frequently, though her body language is closed and wary. 

<p>
Sabrae&rsquo;s tight-fitting leggings and matching shirt are made of soft leather dyed a dark grey and are tucked into her black leather boots and gloves.
She wears her bright mithral armor under her clothing, and is frequently ensconced in her voluminous cloak with the cowl pulled low to protect her eyes.
A black leather belt encircles her waist, hidden under a broad pocketed sash which, like her cloak, is black with turquoise trim.  
A silver headband with a large jewel which also matches her eyes sits on her brow, and a matching amulet hangs from her neck.
She carries a slender sword in a scabbard at her left hip, while a brace of daggers dangle from her right.
Aside from these, she wears a pouch and a scroll case on her belt, a pack on her back, a bow in a case under it, and a quiver slung over her shoulder.
She never removes the two silver rings hidden under her gloves.
</p>

<p>
Although she regrets the necessity of doing so, Sabrae typically uses her <i>hat of disguise</i> to alter her appearance slightly, preferring to appear elven rather than drow, although she usually changes only her skin tone and not her hair, eyes, or facial features.  That her hat is usually disguised to appear as a ribbon in her hair is doubtless due to vanity.

<h4>Personality Profile</h4>
Sabrae is a genuinely sweet person.  She is kind, compassionate, considerate, and patient, and is as quick with praise or a kind word as she is slow with criticism or a harsh word.  She is by nature outgoing and sociable, with a deep-seated need to be liked, but her time on the surface has taught her to be cautious and wary.  As a result, she is lonely and frequently sad, and clings fiercely to her few friends.  To earn her place among those willing to accept her, she tries to pitch in and help with everything she can, readily volunteering her services at cooking, cleaning, healing, fighting, scouting, or whatever else needs to be done.  She is quick to offer whatever help she can even to strangers, without expectation of repayment.

<p>
Active and energetic, Sabrae enjoys hunting, riding, swimming, and other outdoors activities, though she prefers to be active at night where the sun&rsquo;s light cannot hurt her eyes; moreover, she finds something inexpressibly beautiful and wondrous in the moon and stars.  She enjoys swordplay as a sporting activity and works hard to master it, but is soft-hearted perhaps to a fault and does not like violence or indeed any form of conflict.  To Sabrae, violence is only acceptable in defense and is always the last resort.  When violence is necessary, she fights fiercely but is always ready to propose or accept her opponent&rsquo;s surrender.
</p>

<p>
Sabrae&rsquo;s first loves are music and dancing.  She soaks up new songs and musical knowledge, often stopping to give a few coins to strange minstrels to play a song or two, and is happy to pass on what she knows to any who ask.  If permitted, Sabrae sings and plays her flute around her campfire each night, having found this to be a good way to process her emotions of the day, and the one time when she can lower her barriers and just be herself.  Whenever she can, Sabrae spends an hour dancing alone under the moonlight to honor her patron, the Redeemer Queen Nocticula, goddess of artists, exiles, and midnight.  She also pays homage to Ashava (whose concern for dancers, lonely spirits, and moonlight speaks closely to her), Sarenrae (with her emphasis on redemption and compassion), and Shelyn as the goddess of music and beauty.
</p>






<h4>Background</h4>
Sabrae is from Zirnakaynin, a minor noble of House Misraria.  Born with the rare innate ability to disguise herself as a surface elf, she was groomed to infiltrate elven settlements, gain their trust, discover their weaknesses, and report back.

<p>
Her first mission was in 4705 AR, when she was sent to Coralesian, a small town high in the northeastern Five Kings Mountains.  There, Sabrae found something unexpected: this small village felt more like a home than her family&rsquo;s palatial estate.  Life in the village was about more than survival and the struggle for power: there was art, and music, and companionship.  The young drow even found love, in the form of an elf maiden named Cyleria.
</p>

<p>
Sabrae couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of returning to Zirnakaynin to betray her friends in Coralesian, and ultimately decided to defect, living there as a surface elf but dead to her family and friends back in the Darklands.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Sabrae&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade could not be maintained indefinitely.  After five blissful years in Coralesian, she slipped up, and unbeknownst to her, Cyleria discovered her true nature.  She went to the town council, who sent for the Lantern Bearers, and a few weeks later, they arrived.
</p>

<p>
That night, as Sabrae returned to her cabin after dancing out in a clearing to honor Ashava and Nocticula, she had a strange premonition that something was wrong.  Cloaking herself in <i>darkness</i>, she crept up to her cabin and peeked through a window to see a pair of elven warriors wearing a lantern insignia waiting inside, weapons drawn and ready.
</p>

<p>
Fearing for her life, Sabrae fled, and has been on the run from the <i>Shin&rsquo;Rakorath</i> ever since.  She has spent most of the last eight years wandering Avistan, and has tried not to stay in one place for too long.  Only recently has she settled down, this time with a human woman by the name of Sonya Valorian.
