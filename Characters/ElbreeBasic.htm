<h4>Physical Description</h4>




<h4>Personality Profile</h4>






<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
Elbree&rsquo;s mother, a mere human farm girl, fell in love with Archin Adlana. Archin was a young high elf determined to show his family he could make his own choices in life. Whether he was also in love is not known.  What we do know is when the human girl left this world after the birth of Elbree, Archin forbade her name ever be spoken, written, or even thought of. To this day Elbree has no knowledge of her mother other than what we have discussed.
</p>

<p>
Archin returned to his family (new born babe in tow) and set along the path of becoming a master archer. A path his family had planned for him all along. Elbree was not welcomed into the family with open arms. It was obvious she was not a full elf and for a high elf family this was a stain on their prestigious line. It was forbidden however to take the life of a babe and so she was tolerated. No plans for her future were discussed, no effort for her learning was made and no time was wasted in conversing with her. But do not feel sorry for Elbree. Although her childhood may sound bleak, this lack of interest from her family allowed her to choose where, when and how she spent her days. And so, as the years passed she could be found spying on her father&rsquo;s training, sneaking into the forbidden dance house to watch the performing girls and hiding in tight spaces to eavesdrop on grandma Adlana&rsquo;s singing lessons. By the time Elbree was eight years old she could sing, dance and shoot as well as the high elves that had trained with masters for many years.
</p>

<p>
Although Archin was not the ideal father, he did spend a few minutes with Elbree every day. He would make sure she was alive and ask her to tell him of any ill treatment she was receiving. Most of the time she was left alone but the few times someone was really cruel, she would tell her father and that person would never speak to her again. Because of this Elbree assumed her father must have cared for her.
</p>

<p>
When Elbree was ten her father left on a mission. He planned to be away for a few months. However he did not return with the rest of the party. It is believed he came across a human farm girl on his travels. Again he abandoned the family's plan for his life in pursuit of his own desires; leaving all behind, including his young daughter. Without his protection the cruel elves came back to taunt and abuse her tenfold. And when she would fight back, defend herself or simply not allow any harm to be done, she was punished. Punished in what she considered the worst way imaginable. She was sent to her room and not allowed to set foot out of her door for weeks.
</p>

<p>
Six months of this and Elbree decided to follow in her father&rsquo;s footsteps and leave her family behind forever. At eleven years old she stowed away on the peddler&rsquo;s caravan. It was two weeks before she was discovered. She was able to negotiate continued passage. In exchange she gave half the earning she would make performing in the streets of all the towns they passed through. She was also to share any food she was able to catch with her bow. It was a situation that worked for some time. Elbree wasn&rsquo;t getting rich but she had her freedom and the respect of the caravan as she brought in quite a lot of game along the road.
</p>

<p>
It was a year and a half before a better opportunity presented itself and Elbree moved on. This time she joined a gypsy group that infused special spells in with their performances, gaining them additional pay and some notoriety. They did not agree to train her but saw the benefit her dancing would do to boosting their act. For Elbree this was just fine. She had spent her whole life learning by watching others. Soon she was integrating these spells into her own style of dance and doing it better than many of the other gypsies. She was only with these performers six months before word reached them about an opera house on the coast that was in need of singers. Elbree dropped the dancing tour and headed off to sing. That&rsquo;s where she met a few bards and found her true calling. Most of these performing bards only infused simple spells into their music. Spells that made people want to continue listening. But soon Elbree was doing so much more. Her music would cure the simple wounds of hurt travelers and give anyone with in hearing a boost of confidence. When word got out she was invited to join several bands of mercenaries on quests to help out the town. By the time Elbree was seventeen she was a well sought after bard and had joined and left multiple companies.
</p>

<p>
It wasn&rsquo;t until Elbree joined Duncan&rsquo;s group of friends that she even began to think of the future and some form of permanence. Still it was over a year before she acknowledged these feelings and then another six months of Duncan&rsquo;s pursuit before she agreed to a relationship. Elbree and Duncan have been together a year and a half now. They have been through a lot the past few months. The last job they had was to help out a town with a young dragon problem, which turned out to be several adult dragons. Many were killed. Friends and family were lost. Although their physical scars healed quickly the emotional scars run deep. Elbree and Duncan had been off on their own just trying to put the past to rest when Elbree was approached by an old friend, Sabrae.  She was convinced to tag along with Sabrae&rsquo;s company and help out. Of course Duncan was pulled into the scheme as well.
</p>

<p>
And so this is where the story begins. Elbree and Duncan have set off again to join another group. Let us hope that this time it turns out better for all involved.
