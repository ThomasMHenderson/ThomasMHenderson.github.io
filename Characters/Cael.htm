<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class=big>
<h2 class=top>Immediate Actions</h2>
<dl>
	<dt id=FeatherFall>		Feather Fall (Sp)
	<dd>				Once per day, you can use <a href="Spellbook.htm#Feather Fall" target="_blank"><i>feather fall</i></a> at a caster level equal to your character level.
</dl>


<h2>Swift Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=QuickIdentification>	Quick Identification (Sp)
	<dd>				You can use <a href="Spellbook.htm#Identify" target=_blank><i>identify</i></a> at a caster level equal to your character level once per day per 2 pathfinder savant class levels.
</dl>



<h2>Standard Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=AnalyzeDweomer>		Analyze Dweomer (Sp)
	<dd>				You can use <a href="Spellbook.htm#Analyze Dweomer" target=_blank><i>analyze dweomer</i></a> for up to 1 round per class level per day, in 1-round increments.

	<dt id=BondedForce>		Bonded Force (Su)
	<dd>				You can channel magical energies through your bonded ring to create tools, armor, and weapons from pure force. You gain a pool of force points equal to half your wizard level. You can expend 1 point from your force pool as a standard action to create an effect that acts as <a href="Spellbook.htm#Mage Armor" target=_blank><i>mage armor</i></a> (lasting 1 hour), <a href="Spellbook.htm#Shield" target=_blank><i>shield</i></a> (lasting 1 minute), or <a href="Spellbook.htm#Spiritual Weapon" target=_blank><i>spiritual weapon</i></a> (any simple or martial weapon, using your Intelligence modifier to determine its attack bonus rather than Wisdom and lasting 1 round per wizard level). These effects are visible; they take the appearance of armor, shields, or weapons as appropriate, and they always have some visual detail reminiscent of your bonded item.

<p>
At 9th level, when you use bonded force for <i>mage armor</i>, the armor bonus increases by 1; when you bonded force for <i>shield</i>, the shield bonus increases by 1; and you gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls when using bonded force for <i>spiritual weapon</i>. The increases for <i>mage armor</i> and <i>shield</i> and the enhancement bonus for <i>spiritual weapon</i> improve by an additional 1 at 13th level and again at 17th level. When you use bonded force for <i>spiritual weapon</i>, you can choose to reduce this enhancement bonus by 1 to double the spiritual weapon&rsquo;s critical threat range as the <i>keen</i> weapon property, and for <i>mage armor</i> or <i>shield</i>, you can choose to reduce the armor or shield bonus by 1 to protect yourself from critical hits and sneak attacks as the <i>light fortification</i> armor property.

<p>
Alternatively, you can expend a point from your force pool to create a tool of force, which functions as a masterwork version of a simple tool of your choice that could be reproduced by a <i>traveler&rsquo;s any-tool</i> (Ultimate Equipment 323). The tool has the same AC and durability as a <i>spiritual weapon</i> and lasts for 10 minutes. The circumstance bonus the tool of force grants to appropriate skill checks starts at +2 (as masterwork tools) and increases to +3 at 9th level, and by an additional +1 every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
You can only have one instance of bonded force active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previously created force construct immediately ends.

	<dt id=LightningFlash>		Lightning Flash (Su)
	<dd>				As a standard action, you can unleash a flash of electricity. This flash deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and dazzles them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save negates the dazzled effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
</dl>




<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id=AdeptActivation>		Adept Activation (Ex)
	<dd>				You can always take 10 on Use Magic Device checks, except when activating an item blindly, and do not automatically fail a Use Magic Device check if you roll a natural 1 on the check.

	<dt id=AirAffinity>		Air Affinity
	<dd>				If you are a srocerer with the elemental (air) bloodline, treat your Charisma score as 2 points higher for the purposes of all sorcerer spells and class abilities.  If you have the Air domain, you use its domain powers and spells at +1 caster level.

	<dt id=AirSupremacy>		Air Supremacy (Su)
	<dd>				You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Fly skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can cast <a href="Spellbook.htm#Feather Fall" target=_blank><i>feather fall</i></a> on yourself at will. At your 5th wizard level, you can cast <a href="Spellbook.htm#Levitate" target=_blank><i>levitate</i></a> on yourself at will. At your 10th wizard level, you can cast <a href="Spellbook.htm#Fly" target=_blank><i>fly</i></a> on yourself at will. At your 20th wizard level, whenever you make a Fly skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

	<dt id=ArcaneBond>		Arcane Bond
	<dd>				You have a bonded ring.  If you attempt to cast a spell while you are not wearing your ring, you must make a concentration check or lose the spell (DC 20 + the spell&rsquo;s level).  Once per day, you can use the bonded object to cast any one spell that is in your spellbook and that you are capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared.  This spell is treated like any other spell you cast, and cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.  Your bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from your opposition element.  Your rings hit points and hardness increase by +1 per wizard level you possess.

	<dt id=DispellingMaster>	Dispelling Master (Su)
	<dd>				You can spontaneously convert any 3rd-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into <i>dispel magic</i> or any 6th-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into <i>greater dispel magic</i>, as a good-aligned cleric converts prepared spells into cure spells. Every time you successfully use either of these spells to make a targeted dispel or counterspell, you heal a number of hit points equal to the caster level of the effect dispelled or counterspelled.

	<dt id=EsotericMagic>		Esoteric Magic (Ex)
	<dd>				At each pathfinder savant level beyond 1st, you choose a spell from any class&rsquo;s spell list and thereafter treats that spell as if it were on the wizard spell list.  If a wizard could not normally cast that spell, it is treated as 1 level higher than it is on the original class&rsquo;s spell list. This ability does not grant other spellcasters special allowance to prepare, cast, or use spell-trigger or spell-completion items of esoteric spells.  You have selected <a href="Spellbook.htm#Gallant Inspiration" target=_blank><i>gallant inspiration</i></a>, <a href="Spellbook.htm#Good Hope" target=_blank><i>good hope</i></a>, <a href="Spellbook.htm#Invisibility Purge" target=_blank><i>invisibility purge</i></a>, <a href="Spellbook.htm#Flame Strike" target=_blank><i>flame strike</i></a>, <a href="Spellbook.htm#Raise Dead" target=_blank><i>raise dead</i></a>, and <a href="Spellbook.htm#Spell Resistance" target=_blank><i>spell resistance</i></a>.

	<dt id=FastStudy>		Fast Study
	<dd>				You can prepare all of your spells in only 15 minutes, and your minimum preparation time is only 1 minute.

	<dt id=GlyphFinding>		Glyph-Finding (Ex)
	<dd>				You can use Spellcraft to find writing-based magical traps (including glyphs, runes, sigils, and symbols) in the same way a rogue can use Perception to search for traps.

	<dt id=HiddenBond>		Hidden Bond (Sp)
	<dd>				You can change the appearance and magical aura your bonded item at will, as if using <a href="Spellbook.htm#Disguise Self" target=_blank><i>disguise self</i></a> and <a href="Spellbook.htm#Magic Aura" target=_blank><i>magic aura</i></a>, but affecting only the item; for the purpose of <i>disguise self</i>, the item&rsquo;s item type (such as weapon or ring) is its creature type. 

	<dt id=MasterScholar>		Master Scholar (Ex)
	<dd>				You add half your pathfinder savant class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks. You can always take 10 on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks, even if distracted or endangered.

	<dt id=ScrollMaster>		Scroll Master (Su)
	<dd>				You can use your own caster level instead of the item&rsquo;s caster level when using a scroll or other spell-completion item.
	
	<dt id=SigilMaster>		Sigil Master (Su)
	<dd>				You receive a bonus equal to your pathfinder savant class level on saving throws against writing-based magical traps, and if you succeed at the save, you do not trigger the trap. Such a trap is not disabled, and if you leaves the trap&rsquo;s area and then reenter it, the trap can trigger again.  You also receive this bonus on saving throws against the effects of such traps triggered by others.

	<dt id=SilenceMaster>		Silence Master (Su)
	<dd>				You can activate spell-trigger, spell-completion, and command-word items silently, substituting a magical gesture for the necessary words. You cannot use this ability in circumstances where you could not cast a spell with somatic components. You must know how to activate the item normally for this ability to work. Three times per day, you can cast a spell of 6th level or lower as if he were using a <i>silent metamagic rod</i>.
</dl>



<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>
	<dt id=CaelsRing>		<i>Cael&rsquo;s Ring</i>
	<dd>				This ring combines the effects of a <i>ring of wizardry</i> (level 1) and a <i>ring of sustenance</i>.  In its first function, it doubles the wearer&rsquo;s 1st-level arcane spells per day (though bonus spells from high ability scores or school specialization are not doubled.).  In its second, it continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind; its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but this does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.

	<dt id=Haversack>		<i>Handy Haversack</i>
	<dd>				A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does. 

	<dt id=Headband>		<i>Headband of Vast Intelligence +4</i>
	<dd>				This intricate gold headband is decorated with several small blue and deep purple gemstones. The headband grants the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and grants a number of skill ranks in Perception and Appraise equal to the wearer&rsquo;s total Hit Dice. These ranks do not stack with the ranks a creature already possesses.

	<dt id=InsightfulScrollCase>	<i>Insightful Scroll Case</i>
	<dd>				When magic scrolls are stored inside this electrum scroll case, glowing blue runes appear on the surface of the tube, indicating what spells are on the scrolls currently stored within. If the user has the spells on his spell list, he can read the runes while holding the scroll case in hand to cast spells from a scroll within the case as though it were in his hand. Casting spells from the scrolls in the case otherwise works as normal, and the scrolls inside the case are depleted as normal. The scroll case holds a maximum of five magic scrolls, and scrolls stored within are protected against fire, water, and other damage.

	<dt id=ScrollCollection>	Scroll Collection
	<dd>				This collection of scrolls has both combat and utility spells.  It contains
2 <i>scrolls of <a href="Spellbook.htm#Acid Arrow" target=_blank>		Acid Arrow</a></i>,
a <i>scroll  of <a href="Spellbook.htm#Ant Haul" target=_blank>			Ant Haul</a></i>,
2 <i>scrolls of <a href="Spellbook.htm#Blur" target=_blank>			Blur</a></i>,

<h1>Notes</h1>
<hr class=big>
<ul>
	<li>	For esoteric magic later, I suggest <i>heal</i> as a pretty useful choice.
	<li>	Save the rest of your money to buy higher level spells as you can get them!
	<li>	A few notes on the scrolls:
		<ul>
			<li>	<i>Acid Arrow</i> is a long-range spell that bypasses spell resistance.
			<li>	<i>Ant Haul</i> triples a creature&rsquo;s carrying capacity for many hours.
			<li>	<i>Burning Hands</i> is for use against swarms.
			<li>	<i>Daylight</i> dispels <i>darkness</i> spells.
			<li>	<i>Fog Cloud</i> blocks vision and can be cast at range.
			<li>	<i>Invisibility Sphere</i> is just 10&rsquo; radius <i>invisibility</i>.
			<li>	<i>Keep Watch</i> allows several people to get rest as if they&rsquo;d slept for the night.
			<li>	<i>Liberating Command</i> helps people escape grapples and the like.
			<li>	<i>Magic Missile</i> is for use against incorporeal opponents.
			<li>	<i>Mount (Communal)</i> summons several horses for the party to ride.
			<li>	<i>Sure Casting</i> helps the next spell you cast bypass spell resistance.
