This spell functions identically to the spell <i><a href="#Zone of Truth">zone of truth</a></i>, except as noted above. The target momentarily takes on the semblance of a being of perfect order, like an archon or inevitable, so that all who can see the target know it is affected by the spell. This divine guise flickers over the target for only an instant and does not allow it to pass as a member of a different race.

<i>Abeyance</i> suppresses the effects of a single curse on a creature. It does not restore any damage or drain that might have been caused by the curse. <i>Abeyance</i> cannot suppress curses that cannot be removed by <i>remove curse</i>, but it can suppress curses such as lycanthropy that require <i>remove curse</i> along with additional measures. An individual curse can be suppressed only once by <i>abeyance</i>, even if cast by a different caster.
</p>

<p>
<i>Abeyance</i> does not allow a creature to divest itself of cursed objects, though it can suppress a curse contracted from an object.

Invisible layers of solid force surround and protect the target, granting that target a +2 armor bonus to AC. Additionally, the first 5 points of lethal damage the target takes from each attack are converted into nonlethal damage. Against attacks that already deal nonlethal damage, the target gains DR 5/&ndash;. Once this spell has converted 5 points of damage to nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), the spell is discharged.

You purge impure thoughts from the target&rsquo;s mind and fill him with exultant relief at the forgiveness of his sins. <i>Absolution</i> ends all charm or compulsion effects affecting the target (including harmless compulsions, such as <i>heroism</i>) as per <i>break enchantment</i>. If the target was forced to perform any actions contrary to his alignment, monk vows, paladin oath, or similar code of conduct by that charm or compulsion effect, that action doesn&rsquo;t cause him to lose access to class abilities, including divine spellcasting.
</p>

<p>
Unlike an <i>atonement</i> spell, <i>absolution</i> can&rsquo;t reverse alignment change or the effects of willing transgressions, induce a creature to change its alignment, or restore class abilities lost because of misdeeds performed in the past. <i>Absolution</i> automatically works if the caster and the target share the same alignment or the same patron deity. If they don&rsquo;t, but their alignments are within one step of each other, <i>absolution</i> has a 5% chance of success per caster level. If neither of these is true, the spell automatically fails.
</p>

<p>
If using the honor subsystem, casting <i>absolution</i> also eliminates the honor loss for events and actions committed by the target while he was affected by a charm or compulsion effect that the spell ended.

This spell allows you to lay your hand upon a magical glyph, symbol, or other magical spell effect (referred to in this spell description as a &ldquo;rune&rdquo;) and attempt to absorb the essence of its effect. To absorb a rune, you must be aware of the rune&rsquo;s existence (but need not know the details of what it actually does) and then succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the caster level of the spell affect being absorbed) as you touch the rune in question. If you fail this caster level check, the magical rune is not triggered unless you fail the roll by 5 or more. If you succeed at the caster level check, the rune is removed from the surface it was originally placed upon and duplicated on the cloth of a silk glove worn on your hand. The rune remains located on the glove&rsquo;s palm in an inert state for up to 1 minute per caster level. As a standard action taken at any time during that duration, you can transfer the rune to another surface similar to the one it was originally placed upon, at which point the rune&rsquo;s function either returns to normal or dissipates harmlessly as if successfully dispelled (your choice). If the spell&rsquo;s duration expires before you place the rune on a new surface, the absorbed rune dissipates harmlessly. <i>Absorb rune I</i> affects only runes whose effects are equivalent to a spell of 3rd level or lower. An attempt to use <i>absorb rune I</i> on a more powerful effect automatically triggers the rune when you touch it.

<p>
You absorb the toxicity of your surroundings, becoming toxic as a result. While under the effect of this spell, you are immune to diseases and poisons with which you come into contact. When you are exposed to a disease or poison, you can choose to absorb it. Doing so ends the immunity due to this spell to any disease and poison other than the one you absorbed. You remain immune to the new affliction until this spell ends. Casting <i>absorb toxicity</i> on yourself a second time does not allow you to absorb a second toxin, but instead resets the duration of the effect to its full 10 minutes/level.
</p>

<p>
While you have a disease or poison absorbed, you can use a melee touch attack to transfer that affliction to another creature. A missed attack does not discharge the spell, and you can try to transfer the affliction again in subsequent rounds. If you hit, this spell is discharged, and your target must make a saving throw against the transferred affliction (DC equal to this spell&rsquo;s save DC or the affliction&rsquo;s save DC, whichever is higher) or suffer its effect or initial effect immediately. The target then continues to suffer from the affliction&rsquo;s normal effects.
</p>

<p>
If the spell&rsquo;s duration expires before you have transferred the affliction, you are exposed to any absorbed poison or disease as if you had transferred it to yourself, but you gain a +2 bonus on saves against that particular instance of the poison or disease.

You ward all creatures and objects in the area from ranged weapons. The spell&rsquo;s area of effect is often a sphere, although you can shape it to be smaller than the maximum area or to exclude certain adjacent areas or objects (for example, if you are warding a specific structure, or if you are roughly warding the front lines of a battlefield). This spell&rsquo;s area is also up to 40 feet in height, so flying creatures benefit as long as they are in this area of effect.
</p>

<p>
Creatures and objects in the warded area gain damage reduction 20/magic against ranged weapons. Once the spell has prevented a total of 20 points of damage per caster level (maximum 200 points) to creatures and objects in the area, it is discharged.

<p>
You grant your lungs inhuman strength and capacity, allowing you to harmlessly and completely inhale one gas, fog, smoke, mist, or similar cloud-like effect. If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the effect&rsquo;s caster level) to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response.
</p>

<p>
While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to 1 round per level, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud&rsquo;s original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath&rsquo;s area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud&rsquo;s original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud ends this spell. If you do not exhale the cloud before this spell&rsquo;s duration expires, you suffer the cloud&rsquo;s effects and automatically fail any saving throw to resist it.

You absorb the next object your hand touches into your body. If you are already holding an object, you can attempt to absorb it; otherwise, you may touch an object as a standard action separate from casting the spell. You can absorb any nonmagical, nonliving object weighing no more than 1 pound per caster level. A container and its contents count as a single object. Objects in the possession of another creature receive a Fortitude saving throw to prevent absorption. You may continue to attempt to absorb objects until one is absorbed.
</p>

<p>
An absorbed object melds with your hand and cannot be targeted, but the object&rsquo;s weight still counts against your carrying capacity. If you dismiss the spell, the item appears in the hand that absorbed it, or falls to the ground if that hand is full. Multiple castings let you absorb additional items, but you can only store a single item per hand.

<p>
Your targets perceive intimidation and threats as laughably absurd. A character attempting to intimidate your targets is instead perceived as having exaggerated facial features or babbling and awkward speech. Effects that impose fear conditions become objects of ridicule, with the targets making fun of the source of the object as it attempts to scare them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Absurdity</i> protects your targets from gaining lesser fear conditions (spooked, shaken, and scared), granting them immunity to spooked and a 50% chance to negate shaken or scared conditions instead of gaining them from any effect, including uses of the Intimidate skill to demoralize. Any other effect related to a spell or ability that generates fear (such as dying from a <i>phantasmal killer</i>) affects them normally, and effects that ignore immunity to fear also ignore <i>absurdity</i>.
</p>

<p>
However, target creatures also have serious difficulty noticing potential threats; they take a &minus;10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to avoid surprise or to notice that a creature is actively threatening or malicious and a &minus;2 penalty on initiative checks. The spell doesn&rsquo;t prevent spells or effects that provide early warning or a form of danger sense (like <i>anticipate peril</i> or <i>find traps</i>) from alerting the affected character to danger.

Accelerate poison does not change the cure condition for the poison.

The caster can transfer the effects of afflictions such as curses, diseases, and poisons from the target creature to himself. This spell can also transfer the blinded, deafened, fatigued, nauseated, shaken, and sickened conditions. All aspects of the transferred afflictions (save DCs, remaining duration, removal conditions, and so on) remain the same, but affect the caster instead of the original target. After transferring the affliction or condition, the caster is free to cure it in any way he can.

You channel a fell curse through your glare. If the target fails its saving throw, it begins to obsessively second-guess its actions and attract bad luck. Whenever the target attempts an attack roll or saving throw while the curse lasts, it must roll twice and take the lower result. While you cast this spell, an ally within range of the subject can attempt an Intimidate check as a move action (DC = save DC of this spell); on a success, the ally adds its own glare to yours, granting you a +2 bonus on your caster level check to overcome spell resistance (if any). Multiple allies can attempt Intimidate checks; this bonus stacks.

Your animal companion&rsquo;s bite attack deals an additional 1d4 points of acid damage, and the acid deals another 1d4 points of acid damage to the target on the next round. The acid continues to deal damage for 1 additional round per 4 caster levels (to a maximum of 6 total rounds at caster level 20th). This ongoing acid damage doesn&rsquo;t stack from multiple attacks, but the duration resets if a newer bite would cause the ongoing damage to last longer than the duration remaining from a previous one.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Create Pit">create pit</a></i>, except that it places a 5-foot deep pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact with the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may be harmed. Refer to Table 9&ndash;2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition. Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how they became broken) must make a Fortitude saving throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed. The walls of the pit are quite slippery and have a Climb DC of 30.

While you are subject to this spell, you can take two 5-foot steps each round and still cast spells and use spell-like abilities without provoke attacks of opportunity. This spell automatically discharges as soon as you make an attack, cast a harmful spell against another creature, or move more than 5 feet with a single move action. If the action that discharges the spell also provokes attacks of opportunity, that action still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

You blast your enemies with rays of nonlethal force. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels you possess beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of nonlethal damage. This is a force effect. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be fired simultaneously and aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other. The rays hit about as hard as a punch from a strong adult human, and can knock away unattended objects weighing up to 10 pounds if that amount of force could normally do so.

<p>
A crackling, spherical storm cloud flies in whichever direction you point and deals electricity damage to those it strikes. It has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. If it enters a space that contains a creature, the storm stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. It provides concealment (20% miss chance) to anything within it, and its flickering light illuminates the same area a candle would.
</p>

<p>
The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (as a move action for you); otherwise, it stays at rest and crackles with lightning. It can be moved by wind effects and counts as a Small creature for the purpose of determining how winds affect it. The sphere has no physical substance and cannot exert any force on corporeal creatures or objects. It disperses if it exceeds the spell&rsquo;s range.

<p>
You afflict a creature you have conjured via <i>planar ally</i> (or a similar spell) with bolts of vicious energy. These foul energies inflict terrible pain upon the summoned creature, torturing it to make it more pliant to your will. The targeted creature must make a Fortitude save or take a &minus;1 penalty for every 2 levels you possess (maximum &minus;10) on all saves and checks made against you for the next hour. In addition, creatures that demand payment for their services reduce the payment by 20% for every 4 levels you possess (maximum 60% reduction). However, beings tortured by this spell quickly come to resent you, making them more likely to try to pervert your orders to malicious ends or try to seek retribution after their release. This spell has no effect on creatures that are immune to nonlethal damage.

<i>Air bubble</i> creates a small pocket of breathable air that surrounds the touched creature&rsquo;s head or the touched object. The <i>air bubble</i> allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage.

A firearm within an <i>air bubble</i> can be loaded&mdash;assuming the black powder comes from a powder horn, a cartridge, or some other airtight protective device&mdash;and fired. When shooting such a firearm underwater, the shot still takes the standard &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to normal penalties due to range.

You create a powerful blast of air capable of flinging an opponent upward. If the target fails its Reflex save, the force of the air deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and hurls the target upward a number of feet equal to 5 &times; your caster level. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the target strikes the object in the same manner as it would during a normal fall. After this blast of air ceases, the target falls down (unless it was flying), taking falling damage as normal. A successful save means the target takes half damage from the air blast but is not moved by it.

You gain an unmistakable air of authority, which clouds creatures&rsquo; minds and causes them to believe that you are their direct superior. Each creature with whom you attempt to leverage your newfound authority receives a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. Otherwise, it treats you as it would its direct superior. Creatures with different direct superiors see you in different ways, which can potentially lead to conflicts that allow additional saving throws (for instance, if a cook sees you as the head chef, he might be quite perplexed to see the vizier treating you as if you were the king).

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Air Walk">air walk</a></i>, except you can rise no higher than 1 foot off the ground, you cannot pass over liquid, and the air you walk on is less stable than solid ground. When walking on air, you ignore difficult terrain that is less than 1 foot high, you do not trigger effects based on weight (such as a pressure plate), and any creature trying to track you through areas you crossed with this spell takes a &minus;10 penalty on its Perception or Survival check to do so. However, because of the instability of the air you walk on, your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and you take a &minus;4 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Ride checks.
</p>

<p>
If you have 1 rank in Fly, your speed is not reduced when using this spell, and you can cross over liquid at half speed.

<p>
The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to half the air walker&rsquo;s normal speed.
</p>

<p>
A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of a creature&rsquo;s turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.
</p>

<p>
Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the <i>air walk</i> spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an <i>antimagic field</i>.
</p>

<p>
You can cast <i>air walk</i> on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of <i>air walk</i> (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with 1 week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

<p>
You attempt to obtain a glimpse of some specific event from the Akashic Record, the extraplanar repository of all experiences that have ever occurred. This allows you to attempt one Knowledge skill check of your choice per 3 caster levels you have, each with a +10 insight bonus. You are treated as trained in any Knowledge skills used for these checks, and can use this spell to reroll a Knowledge skill check you have already failed. The GM rolls these Knowledge checks in secret, as the Akashic Record is incredibly remote, and impressions gleaned from the distant repository are sometimes skewed when received. On a natural 1, the resulting answer is wildly inaccurate.
</p>

<p>
This spell provides experiential guidance based on your ability to understand the flashes of insight gleaned from the Akashic Record, rather than the perfect knowledge available to those who travel to the extraplanar repository of knowledge. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends. Once you have used this spell to gain information on a specific topic or event, you cannot use it for Knowledge checks regarding that topic or event again until you have gained a caster level.

You create a perfect record of your physical body in the Akashic Record at the time the spell is cast. This record includes your current hit point total, physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), and any conditional modifiers or conditions such as ability damage to physical ability scores, disease, negative levels, and poison. If at any point within the duration of the spell you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points or are slain by a death effect that is not mind-affecting, you can immediately let your current physical body die and assume the record of your physical body on your next turn. When this happens, your corpse disappears, and you can either resume the place of your dead body (already wearing any clothing still attached to the corpse) or appear in any place you&rsquo;ve been within 500 feet of where your corpse lies (but without any of your gear).
</p>

<p>
You still retain your original mind, and therefore don&rsquo;t regain any spells. You are still under any mental influences and energy drain effects you were under when you recalled the record of your physical body, but don&rsquo;t retain any physical effects such as bleed damage or poison (unless you suffered from these conditions at the time the spell was cast). Spells affecting you when you store a record of yourself abide by their normal durations. For example, if you were affected by cat&rsquo;s grace when you created the record and you restore your body 1 hour later, you won&rsquo;t be under that effect anymore since its duration has already expired. This spell doesn&rsquo;t allow you to avoid dying of old age. Casting this spell again replaces any previous version you cast; you can&rsquo;t store more than one copy of yourself in the Akashic Record.

<i>Alarm</i> creates a subtle ward on an area you select. Once the spell effect is in place, it thereafter sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it.

</p>

<p>
<i>Mental Alarm</i>: A mental <i>alarm</i> alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area.

</p>

<p>
<i>Audible Alarm</i>: An audible <i>alarm</i> produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.
</p>

You inflict a curse similar to the spell burn spellblight on a creature. Each time a spellcaster who is afflicted with this curse casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin seems to burn as though she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level of the spell cast or spell-like ability used), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she loses the spell or spell slot and is staggered for a round.
</p>

<p>
You combat the rising corruption in another creature or advance the long-term process of exorcising it entirely. This spell has two purposes, and you choose which application to use at the time of casting.</p>

<p>
<i>Combat Corruption</i>: Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that corruption&rsquo;s Progression section), it advances to the next corruption stage&mdash;at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this spell can lower the target&rsquo;s corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn&rsquo;t at progression stage of 1 or higher.
</p>

<p>
<i>Remove Corruption</i>: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of <i>alleviate corruption</i> doesn&rsquo;t reduce the target&rsquo;s corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.
</p>

<p>
Either application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target&rsquo;s manifestation level + 3 times the target&rsquo;s corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).
</p>

<p>
Tampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it. Casting <i>alleviate corruption</i> on yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it). A creature can be the beneficiary of this spell only once per week, whether it succeeds or not.

<p>
You can transform one object, weighing up to 5 lbs. per caster level, into an edible substance that any living creature can chew, swallow, and safely digest. This allfood always has a bland taste and slightly gooey consistency when chewed regardless of its original nature.
</p>

<p>
One pound of allfood provides enough sustenance to support a Medium creature for an entire day.
</p>

<p>
Objects of similar nature in close proximity, such as a pile of rocks, count as a single object for the purpose of this spell. You cannot use this spell to transform objects with magical or other exceptional qualities. An object&rsquo;s hardness is considered to be 0 for the purposes of eating it, but it retains its normal hardness for all other situations, and becomes no more vulnerable to sunder attacks, break attempts, or any other action typically directed against objects. Objects such as hot coals or a burning torch continue to produce energy even after you transform them into allfood and if a creature attempts to eat such an object, it takes damage accordingly.

In addition, once each round during your turn, you can take a free action to direct your cloak to use the aid another action to assist your skill check, attack roll, or AC. The cloak has an attack bonus or a total skill bonus equal to your caster level plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier (Charisma for bards, Intelligence for wizards, and so on). If another creature dons the cloak during the duration, the cloak provides its protection and aid to the wearer, but it still uses the same bonus on the aid another actions as if you were the wearer.

You glow with a soft radiance that calls out to all who see it. Each enemy that fails its save is drawn to you and must use its move action to approach you at the beginning of each of its turns for 1 round per caster level. An affected target must move toward you in the most direct path it can, though it can step around obstacles or other creatures. This spell can&rsquo;t force a creature to walk into an area that might obviously harm or kill it (such as into a pit, over a patch of floor studded with caltrops, or through a <i>wall of fire</i>). An affected creature that loses sight of you is not compelled to move toward you, although if it later regains vision of you while still affected by this spell, it must again move toward you. Any hostile action against an affected creature (such an attack of opportunity due to its movement) cancels the spell&rsquo;s effect against that creature. Your initial flash of light also increases the light level within the spell&rsquo;s area by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light) for 1 round per caster level.

You create one or more 5-foot cubes of temporal possibility where your timeline overlaps with those of your parallel existences. As a free action, you can summon a duplicate of yourself (not including any animal companions, familiars, intelligent items, or other creatures) from an alternate timeline in one of the cubes you can see, which lasts until the end of your turn. This duplicate has your statistics (though its hit points equal your caster level), threatens all squares adjacent to it, and has any teamwork feats you have. Although the duplicate appears with all of the equipment you currently carry, it cannot use any of its equipment and all its equipment disappears when the duplicate does. This duplicate cannot voluntarily move from the space in which it&rsquo;s summoned. During its brief existence, a duplicate can use the aid another action once to assist you, but it cannot take any other type of action. Once a duplicate disappears, the cube of temporal possibility it occupied dissipates.
</p>

<p>
You can summon only one duplicate before the spell ends. For every 4 caster levels you have beyond 3rd, you can summon an additional duplicate before the spell ends, though you cannot have more than one duplicate in existence at once.

Animals perceive you as a social superior. The starting attitude of animals you interact with improves by one step, and you gain a +2 morale bonus on Handle Animal checks. Helpful animals provide simple assistance (such as using the aid another action on skill checks they understand) as long as the spell lasts, but they flee from attacks and do not support you in combat. At one point during the spell&rsquo;s duration, you can issue a nonverbal command to helpful animals within 60 feet to forage for you; the animal or animals immediately head out into the wilderness to do just that. After 1 hour, the animals return to the location where you issued the command to make you an offering of edible food sufficient for one meal for you and a number of others equal to your caster level.

You alter an instrument so it sounds like a different kind of instrument you are familiar with. The change could be minor (such as making a lute sound like a guitar) or major (making a keyboard sound like drums). All other aspects of the instrument&mdash;such as volume, pitch, and how it is played&mdash;are unchanged. For example, a piccolo made to sound like an organ is no louder than a normal piccolo, can produce only high notes in the piccolo range, and is a wind instrument.

You alter the flow of water in a natural freshwater channel such as a river, stream, or waterfall. The first version of this spell alters the speed of a river&rsquo;s flow. The second diverts the course of the targeted river.
</p>

<p>
<i>Alter Current</i>: The river&rsquo;s current increases or decreases in speed by up to 1 mile per hour per 2 caster levels you possess. A typical placid river travels at a rate of up to 2 mph (no effect on local movement); a swift river travels 2&ndash;4 mph, moving creatures and objects 10 to 40 feet downstream per round; and an area of river rapids travels 7&ndash;10 mph, moving creatures and objects 60 to 90 feet downstream per round. Altering the speed of the current alters the difficulty of swimming in the water accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Divert River</i>: The river diverts its course in a direction of your choosing. The river flows in the general direction indicated, but otherwise conforms to the shape of the local terrain. This spell cannot cause a river to flow uphill, though the river surges over its natural banks and inundates terrain lower than its average depth. Creatures in the path of the redirected river are in danger of being swept away; if directed properly, this spell causes a flood. See Aquatic Terrain in the <i>Core Rulebook</i> for more details.
</p>

<p>
<i>Alter river</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.
</p>

<p>
Clever application of spells such as <i>move earth</i> can be combined with this spell to likewise make the river&rsquo;s new course permanent.

You swap a creature summoned by a conjuration (summoning) spell for a creature you could summon with a <i>summon monster</i> or <i>summon nature&rsquo;s ally</i> spell. The new creature must be an option from a spell of the same level or lower as the spell that summoned the target. The new creature cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support it. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect, but if the target is under your control, it receives no saving throw. <i>Alter summoned monster</i> does not alter the duration of the spell that summoned the target, nor does it affect any additional creatures summoned by the same spell as the target. The new creature has the same conditions and amount of damage as the target creature, and remains affected by all curses, diseases, poisons, and penalties that affected the target, but no other spells or effects carry over. <i>Alter summoned monster</i> is a spell of the same alignment type or types as the creature for which you exchange the target.

You cause the target to lose most of its memories; its skills, its past, and even its name become mysteries to it. While the target can build new memories, it has trouble accessing those gained before falling victim to the spell. The target can still speak and read any languages it knows and perform basic tasks, but it loses all class abilities, feats, and skill ranks gained before being affected by <i>amnesia</i>. It retains its base attack bonus, saving throws bonuses, Combat Maneuver Bonus, Combat Maneuver Defense, total experience points, Hit Dice, and hit points. If the target gains a character level while suffering from <i>amnesia</i>, it can use any abilities gained by that class level normally. If the class level it gained was from a class in which it already has levels, it gains the abilities of a 1st-level character of that class, even though it is technically of a higher level in that class. If the <i>amnesia</i> is cured, the target regains the full abilities of the class, including those gained from any levels taken while suffering from this condition. <i>Amnesia</i> can be removed only by <i>heal</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>psychic surgery</i>, or <i>wish</i>.

You peer into the aura of one target creature or object, gaining valuable information about its condition and nature. Each round, choose one of the target&rsquo;s four auras.

Objects do not have emotion auras, except intelligent weapons and similar sentient oddities.

You know whether the target is unharmed or wounded, whether it is poisoned or diseased, and whether it is under any of the following conditions: confused, disabled, dying, nauseated, panicked, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. Further, your insight into the overall strength of the target&rsquo;s vital force reveals the total number of points available in its ki pool, grit pool, or similar resource.

A ghostly manifestation of one of your ancestors appears before you bearing a weapon of your choice in its hands. The weapon may be any simple, martial, or dwarven weapon. It has a +1 enhancement bonus and one weapon special ability (your choice) from the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> with a price equivalent to a +1 bonus (if the weapon is a double weapon, the ability and the enhancement bonus only apply to one end, or the weapon can have a +1 enhancement bonus on both ends but no other magical abilities).

When you cast this spell, you open your mind to the vast experiences of your ancestors in the hope of learning something pertinent about your current situation. The chance of successfully finding an <i>ancestral memory</i> that is pertinent is equal to 70% + your caster level. Failure indicates you merely gain a +5 insight bonus on all Intelligence-based skill checks for the duration of the spell.
</p>

<p>
Success indicates that you not only gain the +5 insight bonus on all Intelligence-based skill checks, but that one of your ancestors came across a situation or problem similar to one you are currently facing. In this case, the GM provides you with some specific information to assist you in overcoming your problem.
</p>

<p>
For example, a character might encounter a clay golem deep underground, and finds that her magic weapon and spells seem to be useless against the creature. She successfully casts <i>ancestral memory</i>, and &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; the proper type of weapons and spells that work against such creatures.

The target drow transforms into a surface elf. The drow loses her darkvision and light-blindness racial traits and gains the low-light vision racial trait in their place. The alignment and personality of the drow are not affected by the transformation, but the spell conceals her alignment as an <i>undetectable alignment</i> spell. The spell grants the target a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as an elf, though she appears to be an elven analog of herself and can be recognized as such by other drow who know her.

Powerful tendrils grow out of the bottom of your feet or footwear, partially anchoring you to the ground and making it more difficult for others to move you against your will.

These tendrils dig into any surface, but leave no trace of your passing.

The tendrils slow your movement, however; your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet).

You compel a single animal to travel to a spot you designate and deliver a message to a creature you identify. This spell is similar to <i><a href="#Animal Messenger">animal messenger</a></i>, but can affect larger animals. In addition, the target animal is temporarily <i>awakened</i> to sentience (as the <i><a href="#Awaken">awaken</a></i> spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its message. The <i>awakened</i> target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, or Sense Motive. It treats any of these skills that are class skills for you as class skills. The number of ranks you imbue in any of these skills can&rsquo;t exceed the target animal&rsquo;s Hit Dice nor the number of ranks you possess in that skill.
</p>

<p>
The message you send with your <i>animal ambassador</i> can be a verbal message, which the <i>awakened</i> target animal can speak using its own voice or deliver using your voice. It can engage in conversation using its own intellect, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. The <i>animal ambassador</i> is loyal to you, but it is otherwise susceptible to mind-affecting effects like any other creature. You can also send your <i>animal ambassador</i> with an object or container that is within its physical ability to carry, making it deliver the contents to the target of your intended message. If the object it is given to carry is poisonous, trapped, or otherwise inherently dangerous (even if it would normally be dangerous only to the creature receiving it rather than the animal), or if you or your allies attack the target animal, the <i>animal ambassador</i> spell fails and the animal becomes hostile toward you. The <i>animal ambassador</i> intelligently but single-mindedly attempts to deliver the message to its intended target, and you can&rsquo;t task it with other tasks like fighting, scouting, searching for traps, and so on. It leaves on its delivery once it receives its message.
</p>

<p>
Once the <i>animal ambassador</i> has located its target and delivered its message (and object, if desired), its enhanced mental abilities fade within 2d6 minutes. The spell then ends, even if its duration hasn&rsquo;t elapsed.

The target animal grows to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. This alteration changes the animal&rsquo;s size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a &minus;2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature&rsquo;s existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal&rsquo;s modifier to AC, attack rolls, and its base damage. The animal&rsquo;s space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not change. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it&mdash;the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
</p>

<p>
All equipment worn or carried by the animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.

<p>
Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature&rsquo;s possession instantly returns to its normal size.
</p>

The spell gives no means of command over an enlarged animal.

You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.
</p>

<p>
Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can&rsquo;t find a destination on its own. You can attach a small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
</p>

<p>
During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it&rsquo;s written in a language he doesn&rsquo;t know, for example).

All creatures must take the same kind of animal form. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone.

This spell turns corpses into undead skeletons or zombies that obey your spoken commands.

<p>
The undead can be made to follow you, or they can be made to remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed skeleton or zombie can&rsquo;t be animated again.

Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can&rsquo;t create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of <i>animate dead</i>. The <i>desecrate</i> spell doubles this limit.

<p>
You can animate a nonliving rope-like object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope&rsquo;s diameter by half.
</p>

<p>
The possible commands are &ldquo;coil&rdquo; (form a neat, coiled stack), &ldquo;coil and knot,&rdquo; &ldquo;loop,&rdquo; &ldquo;loop and knot,&rdquo; &ldquo;tie and knot,&rdquo; and the opposites of all of the above (&ldquo;uncoil,&rdquo; and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.
</p>

<p>
The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it&mdash;it does not snake outward&mdash;so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hemp rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell&rsquo;s level to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.
</p>

<p>
The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.
</p>

<p>
The spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.

You implant a mental mine within your psyche that triggers against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. Any creature that uses a mind-affecting effect against you triggers the mine, causing psychic backlash against the offending creature. This backlash deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and staggers the target for 1d4 rounds.
</p>

<p>
If the target succeeds at a Will saving throw, it takes only half damage and negates the staggered effect. The mine does not disrupt the mind-affecting effect that triggered the spell. You can use a swift action to suppress the trigger of your mine for 1 round to allow someone to use a mind-affecting effect on you. You can have only one mental mine active at a time.

You transform the touched animal into a bipedal hybrid of its original form with a humanoid form, similar to how a lycanthrope&rsquo;s hybrid form is a mix of a humanoid and animal form. The animal&rsquo;s size, type, and ability scores do not change. It loses its natural attacks except for bite (if it had one as an animal), all types of movement other than its land speed, and special attacks that rely on its natural attacks. One pair of its limbs is able to manipulate objects and weapons as well as human hands do; limbless animals like snakes temporarily grow a pair of arms. The creature&rsquo;s Intelligence increases to 3, and it gains the ability to speak one language you know. It is not considered proficient in any manufactured weapons. It can attack with unarmed strikes, dealing unarmed strike damage for a creature of its size (unless it has a bite attack, which is a natural attack).

<i>Anthropomorphic animal</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell cast by a caster of 11th level or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.

If the target fails its Will save, you also see how the target will react to your attacks, and the bonus applies on your attack rolls and damage rolls against the target.

An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.
</p>

<p>
An <i>antimagic field</i> suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it.
</p>

<p>
Time spent within an <i>antimagic field</i> counts against the suppressed spell&rsquo;s duration.
</p>

<p>
Summoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an <i>antimagic field</i>. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <i>antimagic field</i> in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature&rsquo;s spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an <i>antimagic field</i> because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)
</p>

<p>
A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures&rsquo; spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field. <i>Dispel magic</i> does not remove the field.
</p>

<p>
Two or more <i>antimagic fields</i> sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as <i>wall of force</i>, <i>prismatic sphere</i>, and <i>prismatic wall</i>, remain unaffected by <i>antimagic field</i>. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
</p>

<p>
Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.

You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.
</p>

<p>
Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.
</p>

<p>
A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature&rsquo;s Dexterity score by 4 points.

<p>
You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents technological objects, signals, and creatures from entering.
</p>

<p>
An <i>antitech field</i> suppresses any technological effect used within, brought into, or deployed into the area, but does not negate it. Time spent within an <i>antitech field</i> counts against the suppressed effect&rsquo;s duration.
</p>

<p>
Robots and other technological constructs that come in contact with an <i>antitech field</i> must attempt a Fortitude saving throw each round they remain in the field. Failure indicates a creature can take no actions that round and is considered to be helpless. Success indicates a creature can take either one move action or one standard action that round. Partially technological creatures like androids or cyborgs are merely staggered if they fail this saving throw. Note that cybernetic equipment does not function in an <i>antitech field</i>, and all benefits granted by such gear are suppressed.
</p>

<p>
Non-technological creatures can enter the area, as can low-tech missiles like sling stones and arrows. High-tech missiles such as bullets and missiles immediately halt upon contacting the field, and either drop to the ground harmlessly or detonate. An <i>antitech field</i> doesn&rsquo;t stop rays created by magical sources, but does stop rays fired from beam weapons such as lasers. The <i>antitech field</i> does not offer any protection against explosions caused by technological explosives detonating against it&mdash;thus, creatures within the field could still take damage from a rocket that explodes against it. If a creature is larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of the creature that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.
</p>

<p>
This spell can be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.

You constrain the target such that the target automatically misses with all attacks made against creatures that are not of the opposite alignment of it. For example, a lawful evil target would automatically fail at all attacks except those made against chaotic good creatures, and a neutral good target would automatically fail at all attacks except those made against neutral evil creatures. For the purposes of <i>antithetical constraint</i>, creatures that are chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good are all considered to have the opposite alignment of a target whose alignment is neutral with no other alignment components. This restriction doesn&rsquo;t apply to effects that do not require attack rolls, such as <i>magic missile</i>.

This spell functions similarly to <i><a href="#Plane Shift">plane shift</a></i>, but instead of transporting the targets to a destination near an intended location on a specific plane, <i>anywhere but here</i> transports affected creatures to a random plane. A creature can be affected by <i>anywhere but here</i> only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets can, by chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell). Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is determined by the table below; the location on the destination plane where the transported creatures arrive is completely subject to the GM&rsquo;s whim.

<p>
You cause a creature to temporarily lose interest in a passion or pursuit, taking the heat off your trail to facilitate a getaway, the finalization of a scheme, or the elimination of incriminating evidence. When casting the spell, you designate a subject or activity about which the target becomes indifferent. While under the effects of <i>apathy</i>, the target takes a &minus;5 penalty on all skill checks and ability checks to investigate, pursue, or otherwise advance its goals in relation to the designated subject. In most cases, however, the target does not attempt such checks if they can be avoided, as it simply has no interest in putting effort into the endeavor.
</p>

<p>
If the chosen activity is something that would be harmful for the target to refrain from doing (such as eating, sleeping, or holding its breath underwater), the target receives a +5 bonus on the saving throw or other check required by its inaction, and receives a new saving throw to negate the effects of this spell with the same +5 bonus immediately after. The bonus on these saving throws and checks increases by 1 for each subsequent check required by the same condition. If you directly interact with the target of this spell (such as engaging it in combat or targeting it with another spell or effect), the spell immediately ends.

This charm makes a construct regard you as its master. The spell only affects mindless constructs that are attuned to the commands of a master, such as animated objects, golems, retrievers, and shield guardians. All constructs with Intelligence scores, even those that explicitly follow the commands of their creator, such as an homunculus, are unaffected. If the construct is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.
</p>

<p>
The spell enables you to control the construct completely, with the sole exception that commands directly resulting in damage break the spell. Any act by you or your apparent allies that damages the construct also breaks the spell. You can communicate your commands in any spoken language. The construct reverts to obeying the last commands given by its true master when the spell&rsquo;s duration expires.
</p>

<p>
If the construct&rsquo;s true master attempts to command a construct affected by apparent master, you must win an opposed Charisma check for the construct to continue to follow your commands. Failing this check breaks the spell.

<p>
Creatures under the effect of <i>apparent treachery</i> do not have allies and are not considered to be an ally to any other creature, including other creatures affected by this spell. They cannot move freely through their allies&rsquo; spaces, flank creatures with them, cooperate with them using teamwork feats, or give or receive benefits from the aid another action or any spells or effect that affects only allies. If creatures affected by this spell are able to take attacks of opportunity, they always do so against provoking opponents, including those who were their allies before being affected by this spell.

<p>
A creature not under the effects of the spell who is trying to cast a spell against an affected target must succeed at an attack roll to touch the target, even if the spell is harmless, though the affected creature is not forced to attempt saving throws against harmless effects.

The illusion makes undead creatures of Medium size or smaller appear as if they were living humanoid creatures. You can target a number of undead creatures whose total number of Hit Dice is no greater than twice your caster level. When you create the illusion, you choose the races, genders, and attire for the undead creatures. Additionally, the illusion makes the undead creatures&rsquo; movements appear lifelike (two shuffling zombies could be made to appear as two strolling lovers). The illusion doesn&rsquo;t create smell, sound, texture, or temperature. Undead with Intelligence scores can attempt a saving throw to negate the effect of the spell, but mindless undead do not. Any creatures interacting with the illusion receive a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.

This spell allows you to instantaneously transport a small nonliving object from one location to another. There are two ways to use the spell: sending allows you to immediately send an object held in your hands to a nearby location, while receiving permits you to cast the spell ahead of time on an object and summon it to your location at a later time.

You can&rsquo;t transport an object to the Ethereal Plane. You can send the held object to any square within range, and you don&rsquo;t need line of sight to the target location. You can place the object in the open or inside a container, a pocket, or even someone&rsquo;s hand. If there isn&rsquo;t room in the space you select (either because the space chosen is too small or because there is already something else there), or if the person doesn&rsquo;t want or isn&rsquo;t expecting the object in his hands, it appears on the ground within the target&rsquo;s square instead. You can transport the object to an elevation above the floor as long as the destination is within the spell&rsquo;s total distance limit.

	<td>	You can prepare an object ahead of time to apport it to yourself by casting the spell upon it and assigning a mental trigger to complete the spell. You don&rsquo;t need line of sight to the object to apport it to you, but the object must be within a distance equal to 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels. Completing the spell is a swift action that has the same restrictions as a thought spell component. You can apport an object in this way even if someone holding the object is unwilling to let you take it. Once you apport the object, the spell ends.

You envelop your body with silver radiance that manifests as scales surrounding your body, granting you a +5 armor bonus to your AC and causing your natural attacks and unarmed strikes to bypass damage reduction as if they were good and silver weapons.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you attack with a breath weapon (including effects that are similar to a dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon, such as an <i>elixir of dragon breath</i> or the <i>dragon&rsquo;s breath</i> spell), you can discharge the Apsu&rsquo;s shining scales spell as a swift action in order to infuse your breath with silver light, causing any evil creature caught within the area of the breath to take a &minus;4 penalty on its Reflex save and to lose the benefits of the evasion ability against that breath weapon attack. Evil creatures with improved evasion are instead treated as if they had only evasion when attempting to save against this breath weapon attack.
</p>

<p>
Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, paladins, and warpriests who worship Apsu add Apsu&rsquo;s shining scales to their class spell lists as a 3rd-level spell.

You summon a school of hippocampi (one plus one per 3 caster levels, to a maximum of six at 15th level) to serve as combat-trained mounts. The hippocampi avoid combat if possible but defend themselves if attacked. If any hippocampus attacks, the remaining duration of the spell changes from 1 hour per level to 1 round per level (so if a full 4 hours remained, the hippocampi last for only 4 more rounds).

You use divination magic to enhance the underwater trails in the area around you, allowing you to track creatures through the water as if across soft ground as long as they passed through the area less than 1 week ago (this lets you notice trails that are much older than normal underwater trails). The spell&rsquo;s area moves with you, so you can follow the trail through the water over long distances. Other creatures can also follow the trail as long as they move with you. Because of the plethora of sea creatures in the higher zones, it&rsquo;s possible that the trail that most interests you will be covered by the trails of other aquatic creatures, making this spell even more useful than normal in the Abyssal and Abaddonian zones.

You create a rolling sphere of churning water that can engulf those it strikes. The <i>aqueous orb</i> can move up to 30 feet per round, rolling over barriers less than 10 feet tall. It automatically quenches any nonmagical fires and functions as <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i> against magical fires as long as those fires are size Large or less.
</p>

<p>
Any creature in the path of the <i>aqueous orb</i> takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage, but a Large or smaller creature that fails its save must make a second save or be engulfed by the <i>aqueous orb</i> and carried along with it. Engulfed creatures are immersed in water and must hold their breath unless capable of breathing water. They gain cover against attacks from outside the <i>aqueous orb</i> but are considered entangled by its churning currents, takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage at the beginning of their turn each round they remain trapped. Creatures within the orb may attempt a new Reflex save each round to escape into a random square adjacent to the <i>aqueous orb</i>. The orb may hold one Large creature, 4 Medium, or 16 Small or smaller creatures within it.
</p>

<p>
The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and churns in place. An <i>aqueous orb</i> stops if it moves outside the spell&rsquo;s range.

Aram Zey created this spell for use by his students, both to increase their confidence in their skills and to ensure more of them survived encounters with deadly traps. If you don&rsquo;t have the trapfinding class ability, this spell grants you the trapfinding ability of a rogue of half your character level.
</p>

<p>
If you have the trapfinding ability granted by class levels, however, this spell grants you a +5 competence bonus on all Disable Device checks made to disarm mechanical (but not magical) traps. While under the effects of Aram Zey&rsquo;s focus, whenever you trigger a trap by rolling poorly on a Disable Device check, you may roll a second Disable Device check. This new roll uses the same modifiers as the first roll. If your second roll is high enough to avoid accidentally springing the trap, you avoid setting it off, but still fail to disarm it. Each time you take advantage of this feature, the remaining duration of the spell is reduced by 1 minute&mdash;if less than a minute&rsquo;s worth of duration remains, the spell ends as soon as you reroll your Disable Device check.

<p>
While he was researching the underlying causes of the resonance created by overlapping abjurations, Aram Zey discovered a way to manipulate that resonance to the caster&rsquo;s advantage when encountering magical traps.
</p>

<p>
The protection provided by Aram Zey&rsquo;s trap ward comes into play whenever the caster is subjected to the effects of a magical trap. The spell immediately discharges and interferes with the trap&rsquo;s function in an attempt to counter the trap&rsquo;s magic. When this occurs, make a caster level check as an immediate action. The DC of this check is equal to the trap&rsquo;s Disable Device DC. If you&rsquo;re successful, the trap ward dispels the magical effect of the trap before the effect actually manifests, effectively preventing the trap from triggering for the next 1d4 rounds and ending Aram Zey&rsquo;s trap ward immediately.

This spell animates a tree&rsquo;s branch and directs it against your foes. At caster level 10th or lower, you can target a Huge tree. At caster level 11th&ndash;15th, you can target a Gargantuan tree, and at caster level 16th or higher you can target a Colossal tree. The animated branch makes slam attacks with a Strength score equal to 10 + your caster level. The branch strikes once per round with an attack bonus equal to your caster level + the branch&rsquo;s Strength modifier, adjusted by the appropriate size modifier (&minus;2 for Huge, &minus;4 for Gargantuan, &minus;8 for Colossal). A Huge tree&rsquo;s slam deals 2d6 points of damage, a Gargantuan tree&rsquo;s slam deals 3d6 points of damage, and a Colossal tree&rsquo;s slam deals 4d6 points of damage; the tree adds 1&ndash;&frac12; times its Strength modifier to this damage. A Huge tree has reach 15 feet, a Gargantuan has reach 20 feet, and a Colossal has reach 30 feet. The tree attacks the creature you designate when you cast the spell, and is unable to move. You can direct the tree against a new target as a move action. The tree does not gain a bonus for flanking, nor can it help another combatant flank. It cannot attack a foe you cannot see.

This spell functions as a targeted <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i> spell, except it only affects creatures and it requires a melee touch attack. If the melee touch attack is successful and the spell successfully dispels one spell affecting the target, that spell is instead transferred to you, treating you as the original target. You do not receive a new saving throw or spell resistance check against this spell and must accept its affects even if they are not beneficial. This does not alter the spell&rsquo;s duration; for example, if the spell only has 4 rounds of duration remaining when it is stolen, it only affects you for 4 rounds. If the spell or effect has a duration of permanent, its duration continues for 1 hour per caster level of the original caster, after which it ends. The stolen spell does not revert to the original target.

Your focus becomes a Medium arcane cannon that appears in an unoccupied square within the spell&rsquo;s range. If no unoccupied square is within range, the spell fails. The cannon comes into existence loaded. Each round thereafter, the cannon can either fire or load. A cannon must be loaded to fire. You do not need to supply ammunition for the cannon.
</p>

<p>
On your turn, you can spend a move action to direct the cannon to wheel itself to a new location, moving the cannon up to 20 feet. If the arcane cannon ever leaves your line of sight, it winks out of existence, and the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.
</p>

<p>
The cannon has a range increment of 50 feet. It targets touch attack in the first range increment, and it has no misfire chance.
</p>

<p>
The cannon acts as a weapon with the <i>conductive</i> special weapon ability, which you can use to channel your spell-like or supernatural abilities as long as you are within the range of arcane cannon. The cannon&rsquo;s attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). On a hit, the cannon deals 4d10 damage. The arcane cannon attacks have a critical modifier of &times;4.
</p>

<p>
The cannon has AC 10, hardness 10, and 80 hit points. If the cannon is subject to a spell or effect that requires a save, it uses your saving throw modifiers. The cannon never provokes attacks of opportunity. If the cannon is destroyed, so is your focus.

This spell makes it difficult for the subject to cast arcane spells, use spell-like abilities, and use some abilities granted by arcane spellcasting classes. The subject must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + &frac12; its caster level) in order to cast an arcane spell, use any spell-like ability (even those that come from a divine source), use arcane spell completion or spell trigger magic items, or use any of the following class features that come from an arcane spellcasting class: arcane school powers, arcanist exploits, bardic performances, magus arcana, or witch hexes. Spells, spell-like abilities, or class features that take a free, swift, or immediate action aren&rsquo;t affected by this spell, nor are mythic spells or mythic powers.

You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the <i>arcane eye</i> at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An <i>arcane eye</i> travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead.

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An <i>arcane mark</i> spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a <i>detect magic</i> spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

<i>See invisibility</i>, <i>true seeing</i>, a <i>gem of seeing</i>, or a <i>robe of eyes</i> likewise allows the user to see an invisible <i>arcane mark</i>.

With a touch, you conjure an extradimensional space inside a pouch or pocket. The pocket acts as a <i>bag of holding</i>, except it can hold only 10 pounds per caster level. Regardless of what is placed into the pocket, it weighs 3 pounds.

<p>
This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <i><a href="#Detect Magic">detect magic</a></i> spell, but <i>arcane sight</i> does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.
</p>

<p>
You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura&rsquo;s power depends on a spell&rsquo;s functioning level or an item&rsquo;s caster level, as noted in the description of the <i>detect magic</i> spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.) If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.
</p>

<p>
As with <i>detect magic</i>, you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not artifacts.
</p>

<p>
<i>Arcane sight</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

You unleash the power of zealous conviction to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a burst of metallic, pulsing energy. Only creatures with a neutral alignment component are harmed by the spell; chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good creatures are unaffected.
</p>

<p>
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8) to neutral creatures (with the exception of neutral outsiders, who take 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6). Neutral outsiders are also nauseated for 1d6 rounds. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the nauseated effect.
</p>

<p>
The spell deals half damage against creatures that are chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good, and they are not nauseated. With a successful Will save, the damage is reduced by half again (down to one-quarter).

<p>
You conjure a small stone building on any relatively flat nonliving surface at least 20 feet square that can support its weight (such as the ocean floor or an underwater ridge). The outline of a door is marked on one wall of your choice or on the roof. You and anyone you designate as the spell is cast can pass through the door, which is actually an opaque membrane of force that keeps the surrounding atmosphere from entering the structure. Creatures you have not designated can force their way through the door with a successful DC 28 Strength check. The shelter is as strong as a normal stone building, resists flames and fire as if it were stone, and is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).
</p>

<p>
The shelter contains eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. These furnishings disappear if removed from the shelter. The shelter contains fresh, breathable air that replenishes within the shelter but does not pass through the membrane of force. The shelter&rsquo;s interior maintains a temperature of 70&deg; F regardless of the temperature outside the shelter.
</p>

<p>
This spell can be cast only underwater.

One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he became a god, <i>Aroden&rsquo;s spellbane</i> creates an area within which spells selected by you simply do not function. Select one spell per five caster levels at the time of casting. The spells selected cannot be changed after the spell is cast.
</p>

<p>
<i>Aroden&rsquo;s spellbane</i> otherwise functions like <i><a href="#Antimagic Field">antimagic field</a></i>, except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells. Only the exact spells mentioned are affected&mdash;a <i>spellbane</i> set to prevent the casting of <i>summon nature&rsquo;s ally II</i> would not prevent castings of <i>summon nature&rsquo;s ally I</i> or <i>summon nature&rsquo;s ally III</i>. If you move into an area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is in effect, that spell is affected as if by <i>antimagic field</i>. If the spell affects a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check against the creature&rsquo;s spell resistance to make it wink out.
</p>

<p>
<i>Aroden&rsquo;s spellbane</i> can even negate an <i>antimagic field</i>, another <i>Aroden&rsquo;s spellbane</i>, or any spell that specifies immunity to <i>antimagic field</i> (such as <i>wall of force</i>, <i>prismatic sphere</i>, and <i>prismatic wall</i>).
</p>

<p>
Multiple <i>spellbane</i> effects can overlap. Their effects stack, preventing the functioning of every spell targeted by any of the multiple <i>spellbane</i> emanations. Spell effects created by artifacts or deities cannot be suppressed by <i>Aroden&rsquo;s spellbane</i>.

<p>
When you cast this spell on a weapon, you cause an extradimensional space to open within the weapon. As part of the casting, you can insert a single magic rod or magic staff into the weapon&rsquo;s extradimensional space, after which the space closes. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, a character wielding the transmuted weapon is also considered to be wielding the rod or staff as well. If the rod or staff can be used to make attacks, you can attack normally with the weapon or use the weapon as if it were the merged rod or staff. If the effect created by the rod or staff requires an attack roll to successfully strike a foe, you can make the attack roll as if you were making an attack with the weapon at its highest bonus (including any bonuses the weapon would normally receive) rather than just a normal attack with the rod or staff&mdash;doing so does not allow you to add the weapon&rsquo;s damage to the attack, but instead allows you to use your skill with the weapon to boost your chance of hitting with the rod or staff&rsquo;s attack, spell, or effect.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the merged rod or staff is ejected from the weapon. If you have a free hand, you can catch the rod or staff as a free action; otherwise, it drops to the ground.
</p>

<p>
If the merged weapon is broken or destroyed during the duration of Aroden&rsquo;s spellsword, the merged rod or staff is similarly broken or destroyed.

<p>
You create exact duplicates of the arrow or crossbow bolt you used to kill a creature in the previous round and launch one at enemy creatures within a 30-foot radius of the corpse. You can target one creature per caster level (maximum 15) within range of the burst and must make a single attack roll and apply it to each arrow. These duplicate arrows possess all the intrinsic magical properties of the arrow that killed the original creature as well as those passed on to it by your bow. They also enjoy the full benefit of any bonuses or modifiers you applied to the attack from other magical items, feats, and class or racial features. However, this spell cannot reproduce any spells or other limited-use magical effects that you used to enhance that particular attack. This includes such effects as the <i>true strike</i> spell, as well as any area spell you might have placed on the arrow by means of the arcane archer&rsquo;s imbue arrow class feature.

You temporarily suppress the most powerful qualities of a magical item. This item can be any object you suspect bears a magical enchantment, but if the targeted item is not magical, your spell has no effect. The spell reduces the object&rsquo;s caster level by an amount equal to your caster level, to a minimum of 0. If the item grants a competence, deflection, enhancement, insight, luck, morale, natural armor, profane, resistance, or sacred bonus, the bonus is reduced by 1 for every 4 caster levels the item loses. If the item&rsquo;s caster level is reduced to 0, all its magic qualities are suppressed (as if dispelled) for the duration of the spell. This spell has no effect on artifacts.

You grant the creature touched the ability to breathe with ease air that is contaminated with ash, spores, smoke, dust, or the like. The creature suffers no ill effects from natural airborne irritants or contaminants and gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against magical effects that involve any of these contaminants. In addition, the creature can see through magical obscuring effects caused by dense ash, smoke, fog, or similar concealment up to a distance of 60 feet, although this spell does nothing to enhance sight in dark or shadowy conditions.

Once per minute, if you are subject to a charm effect that allows a saving throw, you may roll twice and take the more favorable result.

When you cast this spell, you take on an aspect of a stag, including some of its physical characteristics. Your features become elongated and sinewy, and you grow a set of antlers you can use for defense. You gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity, your base speed increases by 20&rsquo;, you can move through any undergrowth (including magically manipulated undergrowth) at your normal speed, and can even make a 5-foot step within such terrain.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, when you are hit with an attack of opportunity, you can make a single attack with your antlers against the opponent that hit you as an immediate action. This attack uses your highest base attack bonus plus your Strength or Dexterity bonus (your choice) and deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (if you are Medium; 1d6 points of damage if Small) plus your Strength modifier on a successful hit. The antlers have a critical multiplier of 19&ndash;20/&times;2.

This spell functions similarly to <i><a href="#Alter Self">alter self</a></i>, except for the following differences. You assume the exact form of a deceased Small or Medium creature of the humanoid type. Your voice changes to match that of the form you assume. The creature whose form you assume must be dead and you must have access to its fresh corpse (either dead less than 24 hours, or preserved via <i>gentle repose</i> or similar effect). Any attempt to copy the form of a living creature causes the spell to fail. You do not have access to the assumed form&rsquo;s abilities, memories, mannerisms, or speech patterns. The spell grants a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as the imitated creature.

This spell functions similar to <i><a href="#Assume Appearance">assume appearance</a></i>, except that you can imitate a creature even if you have only a likeness (such as a sketch or painting) that is fairly accurate. If there is an age difference between the likeness and the actual creature, you take on the appearance of the creature near the end of its life. If you have heard the creature whose form you plan to assume speak aloud, you can also copy its voice as <i>vocal alteration</i> (<i>speak with dead</i> can also be used to fulfill this requirement). The spell doesn&rsquo;t grant insight into the dead creature&rsquo;s mannerisms.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, if a likeness used as a focus for the spell is kept on your person or within 30 feet at all times, the aura of greater <i>assume appearance</i> is redirected to the likeness instead of to you, similar to a reverse application of the <i>misdirection</i> spell.

You draw upon the memories of the targets to create a visual disguise for yourself that only they can see. When you cast the spell, you choose an emotion from the table below. Each target perceives you as a creature it feels that way toward. If it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way toward anyone, it instead perceives you as a stranger with features likely to evoke that emotion (e.g., if you choose respect, a guard who was taught to respect her elders but who currently knows no elders might see you as an elderly version of yourself). Since you don&rsquo;t know how you will appear to each target, you must match your actions and statements to fit with the illusion as best you can. While the spell grants a +10 bonus on Disguise checks like <i>disguise self</i> does, you also take a &minus;5 penalty on Disguise checks until you can get a sense of who the target thinks you are. Each target who fails to disbelieve the phantasm and is fooled by your Disguise check takes a &minus;2 penalty on Sense Motive checks to notice your lies, and each emotion choice grants you an additional benefit against such targets, as listed in the table below.

<p>
By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether. You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
</p>

<p>
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
</p>

<p>
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
</p>

<p>
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as <i>dispel magic</i> cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).
</p>

<p>
When this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear, vanishes.

<p>
This spell removes the burden of misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, <i>atonement</i> operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings). <i>Atonement</i> may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Reverse Magical Alignment Change:
	<td>	If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost.
<tr>
	<th>	Restore Class:
	<td>	A paladin, or other class, who has lost her class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her class may have her class features restored by this spell.
<tr>
	<th>	Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers:
	<td>	A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her deity may regain that ability by seeking <i>atonement</i> from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god&rsquo;s intercession.
<tr>
	<th>	Redemption or Temptation:
	<td>	You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.
</table>

<p>
Though the spell descriptionrefers to evil acts, <i>atonement</i> can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question.
</p>

<p>
Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of <i>atonement</i> offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.

You cause the targets to believe they hear any sound you imagine. The sound can include intelligible speech. Instead of precisely imagining a sound, you can identify a sound the subjects know and they imagine it doing what you describe as you cast the spell. For example, you could cast this spell on orc warriors and have them imagine the sound of their chieftain calling for help, even if you&rsquo;ve never heard their chieftain and even if the chieftain speaks in a language you don&rsquo;t understand. All targets hear the same hallucination. You can change the sound as part of concentrating on the spell.

You create a wall of faintly shimmering elemental energy. Upon casting the spell, choose either acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

The wall has no effect on melee weapons or items not thrown as part of an attack.

As you cast the spell, you can limit the wall so that it only affects ranged weapons passing through it in the direction of your choice. Doing so halves the spell&rsquo;s duration.

An <i>augury</i> can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.

The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the <i>augury</i> succeeds, you get one of four results:
<ul>
	<li>	Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
	<li>	Woe (for bad results).
	<li>	Weal and woe (for both).

If the spell fails, you get the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; result. A cleric who gets the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful <i>augury</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>augury</i> can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action.

You can alter the alignment by up to one step on each alignment axis, but can&rsquo;t make the creature appear to have a diametrically opposed alignment. For instance, you couldn&rsquo;t make a lawful evil character appear to be chaotic or good. You can also adjust the power of the alignment aura up or down in level by a number of steps equal to &frac12; your level or fewer.
<tr>
	<th>	Emotion Aura:
	<td>	Your manipulations mask the true emotions of the target, instead depicting any combination of colors on the emotional spectrum that you wish. Creatures attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive checks against the target receive no bonuses on their checks based on information gleaned from the target&rsquo;s aura.
<tr>
	<th>	Health Aura:
	<td>	You adulterate the target&rsquo;s aura to mask the condition of its physical body, revealing instead a wounded status, poison or disease status, and conditions of your choice. You likewise mask the target&rsquo;s available ki points or similar resources, manipulating its aura to suggest any number within the range normally available to the target.
<tr>
	<th>	Magic Aura:
	<td>	You alter a creature or item&rsquo;s magic aura so that it registers to <i>detect magic</i> (and spells with similar capabilities, like <i>analyze aura</i>) as though it were nonmagical, a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. A single casting of <i>aura alteration</i> is sufficient to mask all of the magic auras on the target. If an object bearing <i>aura alteration</i> has <i>identify</i> cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes the aura is false and detects the object&rsquo;s actual qualities if he succeeds at a Will save. If a targeted item&rsquo;s own aura is overwhelming, <i>aura alteration</i> can&rsquo;t alter it.

You emit an aura of subsonic noise and mental imagery that makes concentrating difficult. Any creature within the aura that fails its save takes a &minus;5 penalty on concentration checks. A creature must attempt the Will save upon entering the area of the aura, and the penalty ends as soon as the creature leaves the aura. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the effects of the aura for this casting of the spell, even if it leaves and reenters the aura, but must attempt another Will save each additional time this spell is cast.

An invisible sphere of magic surrounds you, clouding the minds of creatures in the area so they regard even the strangest actions as innocuous. For example, if you and your allies are beating a member of the city guard for information, creatures within the area don&rsquo;t think this is unusual or cause for alarm; if your ally is aiming a crossbow at the queen from a balcony, the affected creatures accept this as normal and unworthy of concern. Any hostile actions by you or your allies against a creature or its allies break the effect of the spell for that creature. When the spell ends (or when the affected creatures move outside of the range of the emanation), observers see things normally but altered perceptions from the earlier events remain. Each mention of the events as noteworthy (such as being questioned about them by an authority figure) allows the target another Will save to break the effect and remember things normally.

This spell makes your eyes glow and allows you to see alignment auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <i><a href="#Detect Evil">detect chaos/evil/good/law</a></i> spell, but <i>aura sight</i> does not require concentration, and it discerns an aura&rsquo;s location and power more quickly.
</p>

<p>
You know the location and power of all chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras within your sight. An aura&rsquo;s power depends on a creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice or an item&rsquo;s caster level, as noted in the description of the <i>detect evil</i> spell. If an item or a creature bearing an aura is in line of sight, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to determine the aura&rsquo;s strength (one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + &frac12; caster level for a non-spell effect).
</p>

<p>
<i>Aura sight</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 11th level or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.

You plant a revulsion in the mind of the subject, causing her to avoid an object or location. You must choose a specific object or place. A location chosen in this way can be no larger than a cube measuring 50 feet on a side. The aversion is entirely in the target&rsquo;s mind, so the chosen object or location itself isn&rsquo;t subject to any magical effect. If the target fails her saving throw, she can&rsquo;t come within 60 feet of the chosen object or place. She makes every reasonable effort to avoid the object of the aversion, but will not put herself in danger in order to maintain the aversion. For example, if the object of the aversion is a bridge but a forest fire is closing in and will likely kill the target, she ignores the aversion and crosses the bridge to save herself. If the target must ignore the conditions of the aversion, she is nauseated until she is no longer violating the aversion.
</p>

<p>
If the target succeeds at her saving throw, she is instead sickened while within 60 feet of the object or place, but isn&rsquo;t compelled to stay away from it.

You awaken a tree or animal to human-like sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the animal&rsquo;s current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened). The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. If you cast <i>awaken</i> again, any previously awakened creatures remain friendly to you, but they no longer undertake tasks for you unless it is in their best interests.
</p>

<p>
An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An awakened plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
An awakened animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can&rsquo;t serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.

<p>
An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any). This spell does not function on an animal or plant with an Intelligence greater than 2.

You amplify the animating force of a construct to more closely resemble a true soul, granting the construct humanlike sentience. To do so, you must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the construct&rsquo;s current Hit Dice). If the construct&rsquo;s master (if any) is present, this is an opposed Spellcraft check. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken&mdash;it is a free-willed creature. Golems previously under another creature&rsquo;s control, either as shield guardians or a golem crafter&rsquo;s creations, break all connections with that creature.

Roll 3d6 to determine the Intelligence score of the awakened construct, and increase its Charisma score by 2d6. It gains feats and skill points according to its new Intelligence score, and the skill points are assigned appropriately for its function, as determined by the GM.

<p>
An awakened construct speaks one language that its creator spoke, plus one additional language that its creator knew per point of the construct&rsquo;s Intelligence bonus (if any). Its alignment is determined by the GM, but is usually within one step of its creator&rsquo;s alignment. This spell doesn&rsquo;t function on a construct with an Intelligence score.

This spell is often used by conjurers as a method to torment daemons and force compliance, for it awakens the broken, anguished memories of the countless souls that the target daemons have consumed. All daemons targeted by <i>awaken the devoured</i> must be within 30 feet of each other. The fragmented memories haunt and afflict the daemons, dealing 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and making the daemons confused for 1 round per level. A daemon that succeeds at a Will save halves the damage and negates the confusion effect.

Creatures within 30 feet of the subject that can hear the target&rsquo;s babbling must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for as long as the babbling persists. Once a creature&rsquo;s fascination ends, it can&rsquo;t become fascinated by the same instance of <i>babble</i> again.

You borrow life force from a living creature and infuse it into another living creature, potentially wreaking destruction on the former and bolstering the life of the latter.
</p>

<p>
Choose an initial target, which must be alive, and a secondary target, which must be alive or undead. The initial target is dealt a number of points of damage equal to 9d6 + 1 point per caster level. A successful Will saving throw halves the damage dealt. The target might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.
</p>

<p>
If the secondary target is a living creature, it regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage taken by the initial target. If the secondary target is undead, it instead takes an amount of damage equal to that dealt to the initial target. The secondary target can halve the healing imparted or harm inflicted to it with a successful Will saving throw (although a secondary target receiving healing can forgo this saving throw as normal).

This spell is subject to the spell resistance of the initial target; if the secondary target is unwilling, this spell is also subject to the secondary target&rsquo;s spell resistance.

</p>

<p>
If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gains the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own.

You infuse a target&rsquo;s shadow with energies from the Shadow Plane, shaping the shadow into one that appears to belong to a different creature, and tricking the target into believing it actually is that creature. When you cast this spell, choose one Huge or smaller creature of the animal type or one Medium or Small creature of the humanoid type. If the chosen creature is ill suited to the target&rsquo;s current environment, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against <i>baleful shadow transmutation</i>. If the subject fails its Will save, it believes that it is the chosen creature, causing it to lose its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, lose its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gain the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren&rsquo;t extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.
</p>

<p>
When the subject is first targeted by this spell, and once every 24 hours thereafter, the subject must attempt a Will save in order to disbelieve this effect. If the save succeeds, the spell&rsquo;s effect ends. The first time the subject fails this save, it must also attempt a Fortitude save. If it also fails this Fortitude save, the subject permanently assumes the form of the chosen animal or humanoid, as per <i><a href="#Polymorph">polymorph</a></i>. This is a polymorph effect. Successfully disbelieving the spell returns the subject to its true form. If the subject fails its Fortitude save against the effects of <i>baleful shadow transmutation</i>, any further <i>polymorph</i> effects cast on the target automatically fail.

For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere&rsquo;s course.
</p>

<p>
If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a &minus;4 penalty on this saving throw.

Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it&rsquo;s a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest.

You strip all creatures within the emanation of any gifts associated with corruptions. Abilities associated with corruptions cease to function, as if they were magically dispelled. The corruption stains still fully affect creatures. A creature that enters the emanation and fails its saving throw loses its gifts until the spell&rsquo;s duration ends, even if it leaves the emanation, but a successful saving throw renders a creature immune to the spell, even if it enters and exits the emanation several times.

With a melee touch attack you can dispel an illusion or return a creature to its natural form. This functions as <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i> directed at the effect in question, except you receive a +2 enhancement bonus on your dispel check and you can only dispel illusions or changes in form created by supernatural effects or spells. If multiple effects are changing the creature&rsquo;s appearance, you can dispel one such effect for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest caster level spells and proceeding to spells with lower caster levels.
</p>

<p>
The caster level for supernatural abilities such as change shape is equal to the target creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice. A creature returned to its natural form by <i>banish seeming</i> is prevented from changing its form again for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.
</p>

<i>Banish seeming</i> has no effect on nonmagical means of changing appearance, such as that provided by a disguise or extraordinary ability.

You imbue a weapon with the power to drive foes back. The first time each round the weapon strikes a creature, the weapon attempts a free bull rush combat maneuver check against that creature. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The combat maneuver for the bull rush is equal to 1d20 + your caster level. You do not have to move to push creatures more than 5 feet with this bull rush. If a creature you strike has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check to overcome its spell resistance the first time you strike it. If you fail, that creature is immune to the effects of this casting of <i>banishing blade</i>.
</p>

<p>
The first time each extraplanar creature whose Hit Dice don&rsquo;t exceed your caster level is driven back at least 10 feet by this spell, it must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it is sent back to its home plane. Whether it succeeds or fails, that creature is staggered for 1 round and <i>banishing blade</i>&rsquo;s duration ends.

A <i>banishment</i> spell is a more powerful version of the <i><a href="#Dismissal">dismissal</a></i> spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished.
</p>

<p>
You can improve the spell&rsquo;s chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target&rsquo;s Spell Resistance (if any), and the saving throw DC increases by 2.
</p>

<p>
Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against Spell Resistance and increasing the save DC by 4).

You change the target&rsquo;s head into that of a bull. The creature&rsquo;s Intelligence becomes 2, and it gains a gore melee attack that it can use as a primary or secondary attack. The gore attack uses the creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus, and the creature gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the gore attack.

The gore attack deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + Strength modifier if the target is Small, 1d8 + Strength modifier if the target is Medium, and 2d6 + Strength modifier if the target is Large or larger.

<p>
The affected creature still retains its type, class, levels, and Hit Dice. The creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points remain unmodified.

You summon a chain from another realm, causing it to burst out from the ground and strike a target within the spell&rsquo;s range. You can have the chain either make a melee attack (dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage) or attempt a trip combat maneuver against the target. The chain uses your base attack bonus plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier as its attack bonus and combat maneuver bonus. On a successful hit or combat maneuver check, the target must attempt a Will save. If it fails its save, the creature is shaken for 1d4 rounds.

<i>Barrow haze</i> creates a bank of fog similar to that created by <i><a href="#Fog Cloud">fog cloud</a></i>, except that the vapors are black and they have a necromantic link to you.

You hurl a fist-sized ball of force resembling a sphere of spikes to ram a designated creature or object. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. On a successful hit, you deal 1d6 points of force damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). For every 5 caster levels you possess beyond 5th, you gain a second ball of force.
</p>

<p>
A creature struck by any of these is subject to a bull rush attempt. The force has a Strength modifier equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). The CMB for the force&rsquo;s bull rush uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, adding the force&rsquo;s Strength modifier and a +10 bonus for each additional blast directed against the same target. Each sphere of force makes its own separate bull rush attempt&mdash;if multiple spheres strike one target, you make multiple CMB checks but only take the highest result to determine success. If the bull rush succeeds, the force pushes the creature away from you in a straight line, and the creature must make a Reflex save or fall prone. This spell pushes an unattended object struck by it 20 feet away from you, provided it weighs no more than 25 pounds per level (maximum 250 pounds). This spell cannot move creatures or objects beyond your range. Used on a door or other obstacle, the spell attempts a Strength check to destroy it if the sheer damage inflicted by the spell doesn&rsquo;t do the job.

It&rsquo;s strong enough to support Huge or smaller creatures weighing no more than 2,000 pounds total, and has enough handholds and footholds that it can be climbed as if it were knotted rope (Climb DC 5). At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the beanstalk withers and dies at an accelerated rate, leaving nothing more than a pile of compost.

The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject&rsquo;s Constitution drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.

As a way to befuddle your target, you fill its mind with all manner of swirling images as well as baffling and incoherent thoughts, making the target an ineffective combatant and rendering its spellcasting and other such abilities much more feeble.
</p>

<p>
For the spell&rsquo;s duration, the DCs of all of the target&rsquo;s spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and extraordinary abilities are reduced by 4. Any of its attacks that would deal hit point damage, including its melee and ranged physical attacks, deal minimum damage for the duration of this spell.
</p>

<p>
This curse applies only to effects created by the creature while this spell is actively affecting the target; applying or removing this curse doesn&rsquo;t alter the ongoing damage of effects previously created by the target (such as an <i>incendiary cloud</i> spell that was cast before the target became affected by this spell).

You offer an object to an adjacent creature, and entice it into using or consuming the proffered item. If the target fails its Will save, it immediately takes the offered object, dropping an already held object if necessary. On its next turn, it consumes or dons the object, as appropriate for the item in question. For example, an apple would be eaten, a potion consumed, a ring put on a finger, and a sword wielded in a free hand. If the target is physically unable to accept the object, the spell fails. The subject is under no obligation to continue consuming or using the item once the spell&rsquo;s duration has expired, although it may find a cursed item difficult to be rid of.

An overwhelming feeling of loss overcomes the targets, and their allies&rsquo; words sound bleak and hollow. Regardless of actual allegiances, affected creatures no longer count as allies for other creatures and always count as enemies for the purposes of abilities, effects, and spells that differentiate between allies and enemies, such as flanking or spells such as <i>bane</i> or <i>bless</i>. Allies of an affected creature must succeed at a melee touch attack to affect the subject with touch spells, and an affected creature cannot voluntarily fail a saving throw even if the effect is harmless (such as <i>cure light wounds</i>). An affected creature still counts as her own ally and can target herself with abilities, effects, and spells normally.

You call upon the restless souls of those who died at sea. This spell can be cast only on an area of deep water. When a creature enters the area, the haunt manifests, automatically grabbing the creature and dragging it under the water on initiative count 10. Each round, the haunt deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage as it drags its victim down 10 feet; a successful DC 15 Swim check reduces the descent to 5 feet and negates the nonlethal damage. Each round in the haunt&rsquo;s clutches reduces the duration the victim can hold her breath by 2 rounds. A victim can make a single move or standard action each round while in the haunt&rsquo;s grasp if she succeeds at a Will save; on a failed save, she can only struggle helplessly against the haunt. A victim cannot use her actions to swim toward the surface while the haunt is active. If the haunt reaches the bottom of its body of water, it pounds its victim against the bottom, dealing 2d6 points of nonlethal damage per round to the victim and reducing the duration the victim can hold her breath by an additional round. This continues until either the haunt is neutralized (in which case the victim must still swim to the surface) or the victim drowns.
</p>

<p>
The haunt can grab and attempt to drown multiple creatures in its area on its initiative count. The magic holding the haunt together is unstable and deteriorates while the haunt is active. Each round at the end of its turn, the haunt automatically loses 1d6 hit points per creature it is currently affecting. Furthermore, the spell&rsquo;s haunt-like manifestation is active throughout the spell&rsquo;s duration, rendering it vulnerable to effects that damage haunts. When the haunt reaches 0 hit points, the spell ends.

You transfer one or more of your paladin or antipaladin auras (such as aura of courage and aura of resolve) to another creature. You retain the personal effect of that aura, but the target becomes the center of the aura effect instead of you.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you transfer your aura of courage, you remain immune to fear, but the target becomes the center of the aura that grants a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects. If an aura functions only when you are conscious, the transferred aura functions only when the target is conscious.
</p>

<p>
If an aura functions only when you expend uses of another ability (such as with aura of justice or aura of vengeance), the transferred aura functions only if the target has that other ability and expends uses of it to activate the aura.

If a specific affliction is bestowed, the save DC of the spell replaces the usual save DC of the affliction. You can also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.

<p>
The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell. It cannot be removed with <i>remove curse</i> or suppressed with <i>abeyance</i>. The DC to remove the curse with <i>break enchantment</i> increases by 5.

This spell draws upon the latent planar energy of the caster&rsquo;s surroundings, allowing her to temporarily infuse a creature with the plane&rsquo;s power. The touched creature gains that plane&rsquo;s basic infusion for the spell&rsquo;s duration. This spell has no effect if cast on the Material Plane, and it ends as soon as the spell&rsquo;s target leaves the plane with which it has been infused. Once a creature gains the benefits of <i>bestow planar infusion I</i>, it remains attuned to that plane for 24 hours. Additional castings of <i>bestow planar infusion I</i> during this time bestow the same infusion that was granted by the initial casting that day. Planar infusions that can be used a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by multiple castings of <i>bestow planar infusion I</i>.

<p>
The spell creates an identical copy of you, along with everything you wear and carry, anywhere you choose within range; you exist in two places at once until the spell ends. You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources.
</p>

<p>
If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you&rsquo;re carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn&rsquo;t duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.
</p>

<p>
You perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don&rsquo;t find them disorienting.
</p>

<p>
When you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell, you can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can&rsquo;t also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn&rsquo;t take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn&rsquo;t move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.
</p>

<p>
The two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same <i>fireball</i>, you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by <i>hold person</i>, both would become paralyzed on a failed save.
</p>

<p>
Both bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can&rsquo;t be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don&rsquo;t count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.
</p>

<p>
Any magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you&rsquo;re bilocating. For example, the <i>hold person</i> spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds&rsquo; worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared. If you were under an eagle&rsquo;s splendor effect that had 1 minute remaining when you cast <i>bilocation</i>, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.
</p>

<p>
When the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate. If you are carrying artifacts when you do this, they transfer with your consciousness.

<p>
This variant of <i><a href="#Planar Binding">planar binding</a></i> is specifically used to call one of the most knowledgeable types of outsiders: the immortal and prophetic caulborn. This spell calls a single caulborn into a specially prepared trap. The caster of this spell can compel a bound caulborn only to provide information (using its Knowledge skills or <i>detect thoughts</i>); attempts to compel the caulborn to fight, guard a location, or perform some other task automatically fail.
</p>

<p>
This spell otherwise functions as <i>planar binding</i>. The most effective gifts for a caulborn are unique books or intelligent creatures upon whose thoughts the caulborn can feed. The true names of caulborn are nearly impossible to discover, as they are not inherently individualistic, but certain reclusive scholar communities in Kaer Maga may know titles by which specific caulborn can be called.

<p>
A <i>binding</i> spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level.
</p>

<p>
You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <i>suggestion</i>, your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <i>dominate animal</i>, <i>dominate person</i>, or <i>dominate monster</i>, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant&rsquo;s level, provided that the spell&rsquo;s target is appropriate for a <i>binding</i> spell. Since the assistants&rsquo; spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants&rsquo; spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the <i>binding</i> lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the version of <i>binding</i> you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature&rsquo;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don&rsquo;t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.
</p>

<p>
If you cast any of the first three versions of <i>binding</i> (those with limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding</i> spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell&rsquo;s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature&rsquo;s save succeeds, all <i>binding</i> spells it has received are broken.
</p>

<p>
The <i>binding</i> spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Chaining:
	<td>	The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>antipathy</i> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.
<tr>
	<th>	Slumber:
	<td>	This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell&rsquo;s save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a <i>sleep</i> effect.
<tr>
	<th>	Bound Slumber:
	<td>	This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a <i>sleep</i> effect.
<tr>
	<th>	Hedged Prison:
	<td>	The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.
<tr>
	<th>	Metamorphosis:
	<td>	The subject assumes <i>gaseous form</i>, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.
<tr>
	<th>	Minimus Containment:
	<td>	The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.
</table>

<p>
You can&rsquo;t dispel a <i>binding</i> spell with <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar effect, though an <i>antimagic field</i> or <i>mage&rsquo;s disjunction</i> affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by <i>dismissal</i>, <i>banishment</i>, or a similar effect.

If the target is a creature, it treats all areas of earth and stone it moves through as difficult terrain. Furthermore, for each 5 feet a creature moves through such areas, it takes 1d6 points of damage. Creatures with a burrow speed or the earth glide ability are unaffected by <i>binding earth</i>.
</p>

If cast on an unattended object resting on an area of stone or earth, the stone or earth warps and wraps around it, pulling it firmly to the ground. A DC 15 Strength check is required to pull the object free from snapping earth or stone.

For the spell&rsquo;s duration, the caster gains a reservoir of luck with a total number of points equal to 1 point per 2 caster levels. During the spell&rsquo;s duration, the caster can spend 1 point from this reservoir when making an attack roll or skill check to add a +1d8 luck bonus to the d20 roll&rsquo;s result. This bonus can be added before or after the roll or check&rsquo;s result is revealed, and if this bonus is large enough to turn a failure into a success, the roll succeeds. The spell instantly ends when all points are expended or when it is cast on the target again.

Your voice becomes suffused with magic so that you can harm your opponents with but a word. As a standard action, you can target one opponent within 30 feet with a ranged touch attack by speaking to it, dealing an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. The damage dealt is bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and can be reduced by damage reduction. Each attack you make reduces the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.
</p>

<p>
You can attack with <i>biting words</i> by shouting instead of speaking intelligibly. When doing so, the amount of damage dealt by the attack is reduced to 1d4 + &frac12; your Strength or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher), but the spell doesn&rsquo;t count as having the language-dependent descriptor for that attack.

The <i>black spot</i> is a specific and feared pirate curse. An intangible, illusory <i>black spot</i> manifests above the target&rsquo;s head and remains until the target dies or the curse is lifted. The <i>black spot</i> cannot be covered or hidden by any means, including other illusions.
</p>

<p>
The <i>black spot</i> radiates a cursed aura in a 10-foot radius around its target. Anyone within the aura gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. In addition, the target has a &minus;4 penalty on saving throws against death effects.
</p>

<p>
Every day in which a creature bears a <i>black spot</i>, it must make a Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage. The damage cannot be healed until the <i>black spot</i> is removed. If the creature&rsquo;s Constitution reaches 0, it dies. Pirates killed by this spell often return as ghosts, but that is not a direct effect of this spell.

This spell causes a field of rubbery <i>black tentacles</i> to appear, burrowing up from the floor and reaching for any creature in the area.
</p>

<p>
Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of your turn, including the round that <i>black tentacles</i> is cast. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentacles&rsquo; CMB, the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their Strength and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.
</p>

<p>
If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The <i>black tentacles</i> spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that <i>black tentacles</i> succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The CMD of <i>black tentacles</i>, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.
</p>

<p>
The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last.

This spell creates an invisible magic field that does not stop weapons (whether manufactured or natural) from moving toward you, but impedes their motion when they are retracted.
</p>

<p>
When you are hit with a melee attack, attempt a caster level check against your opponent&rsquo;s CMD. If your check succeeds, your opponent&rsquo;s attacking weapon or body part becomes caught in the field, as if magically affixed to your body. If your check fails, your opponent may retract its weapon.
</p>

<p>
If your opponent&rsquo;s melee weapon becomes trapped in the field, the opponent may release the weapon and move away from you. If your opponent attacked with a part of its body (such as a fist, a horn, a tail, etc.) or it attacked with a weapon but refuses to release it, your opponent gains the grappled condition. Because you are not using any part of your body to maintain control over your opponent, you do not gain the grappled condition.
</p>

<p>
Once an opponent&rsquo;s weapon is snared, you may attempt a new caster level check against that opponent&rsquo;s CMD on each of your subsequent turns to maintain the grapple. This is a standard action, during which you may make any of the usual grappling actions, but if you choose to pin the opponent, you gain the grappled condition as well. On your opponent&rsquo;s turn, it may try to retract its weapon or limb by attempting a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, the DC of which is equal to the spell&rsquo;s saving throw.
</p>

<p>
While <i>blade snare</i> is active, you may make melee attacks and cast spells as normal, though you may not make ranged weapon attacks; the magic field thwarts such attacks. You may not snare more than one limb or weapon in the field at a time.
</p>

<p>
If you already have an opponent&rsquo;s weapon or limb stuck in the field and you are hit by a second melee attack, you must choose which weapon or limb to snare. The other limb or weapon is unaffected by the spell.

You summon an insubstantial spirit of force that resembles a cloudy vapor hovering around your fists or any melee weapons you wield. The spirit compensates for your defensive or reckless melee attacks, nudging your weapons in the proper direction. When you voluntarily use one or more actions or feats that apply penalties to attack rolls with your melee weapons (such as a charge, fighting defensively, or using the Power Attack feat), the spirit reduces the total penalty on affected attacks by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0). The penalty is reduced by an additional 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess (to a minimum penalty of 0). Only penalties incurred by voluntary use of feats or maneuvers are reduced by this spell.
</p>

<p>
The spirit can&rsquo;t be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, a <i>rod of cancellation</i>, or a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> can affect it. A protective spirit&rsquo;s AC against touch attacks is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier.

When you cast this spell, you immediately move up to 30 feet in a straight line any direction, momentarily leaving a multi-hued cascade of images behind you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You may make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against any one creature you are adjacent to at any point along this 30 feet.

<p>
Originally used by the winter witches on the field of battle in the early days of Irrisen, blast barrier has entered the oral traditions of many northern barbarian tribes as legends of winter witches possessing powers to bend the very ground of a battlefield to their will. Blast barrier, however, has proven to be an exceptionally versatile spell as far as terrains are concerned, for it works equally well in swamps, deserts, or any region where the ground is soft or easy to shape.
</p>

<p>
When you cast blast barrier, you cause a rippling wall of loose earth, mud, snow, sand, or gravel to spring up in a designated space within the spell&rsquo;s range. This wall provides total cover to all Large or smaller creatures and objects. The barrier can only spring up in an area of natural, unworked ground. The energy that forms the wall&rsquo;s matrix is unstable, and you must concentrate to maintain the wall&rsquo;s shape. A blast barrier has an AC of 9, hardness 0, and 5 hit points per caster level. When a blast barrier reaches 0 hit points, or when you cease concentrating on maintaining it, the energies that maintain the barrier&rsquo;s shape fail with explosive results, sending sharp chunks of the materials comprising the wall and magical energy out along both sides. Any creature that is adjacent to a blast barrier when it explodes takes 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of sonic damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 6d6). A successful Reflex save halves the total damage done. Spell resistance applies as well.

This instability can make using a blast barrier risky, but many of the spellcasters that pioneered the spell became experts at its tactical applications, often using the barriers to cover an escape while lobbing spells and parting shots, hoping to trigger the barrier&rsquo;s destruction just as their would-be pursuers approached.

With a spiraling gesture of your hand and a forceful exhalation, you create a brief but fierce (90 mph) blast of wind. This spell functions as <i><a href="#Gust of Wind">gust of wind</a></i>, except all creatures within the area are treated as though they were one size category smaller for the purpose of determining how the spell affects them. For every 4 caster levels beyond 7th, creatures in the area are treated as an additional size category smaller (to a maximum of three size categories smaller at 15th level).

You fall unconscious but also unleash a spectacular wave of holy energy that heartens and heals your allies while leaving your opponents daunted and damaged. You can cast this spell as either a standard action on your turn, or as an immediate action when brought to below 0 hit points. If cast as a standard action, you are immediately reduced to &minus;1 hit points, but stable, after casting the spell.

<p>
When you cast this spell, any good creature within range is healed for 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels. All evil creatures within range take the same amount as damage instead (a successful Will save halves this damage). In addition, all allies and enemies within range are affected as if by the <i>prayer</i> spell for 1 round per caster level.

This spell changes the appearance of the affected creature so that it better blends in with its surroundings. As chosen by you, the affected creature takes on the appearance of a statue, furniture, a tree, a bush, a rock, or another object of similar size. As long as the target stays still, it gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks, and it can use Stealth even if it is being observed. The target&rsquo;s armor blends in perfectly with the illusory shape, and the target&rsquo;s armor check penalty on Stealth checks is negated for the duration of the spell. If the target moves at all while this spell is in effect, the spell ends.

This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the DR of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures (though the spell doesn&rsquo;t grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good-aligned, which means it can bypass the DR of certain creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don&rsquo;t confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.
</p>

<p>
In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a <i>keen</i> weapon or a <i>vorpal sword</i>.

The target is considered to be armed even when unarmed, so it doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity when it attacks foes with unarmed strikes. Its unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage (target&rsquo;s choice). If the target already has this ability (such as from the monk unarmed strike ability or the Improved Unarmed Strike feat), its unarmed strikes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, and they count as good-aligned weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

When you cast this on a creature, its skin turns slick and clammy and it is able to regenerate damage each round. While under the effects of the spell, the creature gains fast healing 5, fire resistance 20 and a +2 competence bonus to its Combat Maneuver Defense.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Bless">bless</a></i>, except as noted. It works only in the caster&rsquo;s home city, and in areas under the jurisdiction of the city watch. For example, if the watch patrols a shantytown outside the city walls but not the ruined subterranean tunnels that lie beneath the city, the spell works in the former area but not the latter.

You blast your enemies with blinding rays of sunlight. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit. If a ray hits, it explodes into powerful motes of light, and the target must save or be blinded for 1 round. If the target has light blindness, light sensitivity, or is otherwise vulnerable to bright light, it instead must save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4). Any creature blinded by a ray sheds light as a sunrod for the duration of its blindness. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

<p>
You &ldquo;blink&rdquo; quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane and look as though you&rsquo;re winking in and out of reality at random. <i>Blink</i> has several effects, as follows.
</p>

<p>
Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn&rsquo;t help opponents, since you&rsquo;re ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).
</p>

<p>
If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.
</p>

<p>
Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you&rsquo;re blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).
</p>

<p>
While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
</p>

<p>
Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.
</p>

<p>
You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
</p>

<p>
While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.
</p>

<p>
Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
</p>

<p>
An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
</p>

<p>
An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
</p>

<p>
Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can&rsquo;t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
</p>

<p>
Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.

You unleash an insulting tirade so vicious and spiteful that enemies who hear it are physically scorched by your fury.

Enemies that are demoralized this way take 1d10 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Spell resistance can negate the fire damage caused by this spell, but does not protect the creature from the demoralizing effect.

You learn the answers to a specific set of questions about a creature so long as you have access to at least one drop of its blood. You can cast this spell on the blood of the living or the dead, but living or undead creatures are entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell. You can cast the spell on dried or fresh blood. Once you cast the spell the answers to the following four questions appear on any flat surface you designate (a wall, a piece of paper, and so on).
<ul>
	<li>	Who are you? (The name by which the creature is most commonly known)
	<li>	What are you? (Gender, race, profession/role)
	<li>	How was your blood shed? (Brief outline of the events that caused its wound, to the best of the victim&rsquo;s knowledge)
	<li>	When was your blood shed?
</ul>
These answers always appear in a language you can read even if the creature cannot speak that or any language.

The target gains a 5-foot-radius aura that causes the blood of creatures in that area to ignite upon contact with air. Any creature (including the spell&rsquo;s target) within the aura that takes at least 5 points of piercing, slashing, or bleed damage from a single attack automatically creates a spray of burning blood. The spray strikes a creature in a randomly determined square adjacent to the injured creature. The spray deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature in that square, and 1 point of splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the spray&rsquo;s target, including the target of this spell. A creature can only create one spray of burning blood per round. Creatures that do not have blood (including oozes and most constructs and undead) do not create blood sprays when attacked.

The temperature of the target creature&rsquo;s blood (or other similar body fluid) begins to rise over the next 3 rounds during the caster&rsquo;s turn. Each round starting with the first, the target creature attempts a new saving throw at the start of the caster&rsquo;s turn to resist that round&rsquo;s effect. A successful save does not end the spell effect, but does prevent that round&rsquo;s effect. On the round that this spell is cast, the target becomes fatigued. On the next round, as the blood temperature begins to rise, the target&rsquo;s capillaries burst, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage to the target. On the third and final round, the target&rsquo;s blood begins to boil; the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 15d6), and&mdash;if the target is still alive&mdash;the target becomes exhausted rather than fatigued.

Your unarmed strikes release blasts of energy in the form of bolts of fire or glowing red crows, which fly instantaneously to strike your target. You can make unarmed strike or flurry of blows attacks against the target as if it were in your threatened area; each successful attack deals damage as if you had hit it with your unarmed strike, except half the damage is fire and half is negative energy (this negative energy does not heal undead). For example, if you are a 14th-level monk, you can use a flurry of blows to attack five times, creating one energy crow for each successful attack against the target, and dealing 2d6 points of damage (plus appropriate unarmed strike modifiers) with each crow.

You cast <i>blood money</i> just before casting another spell. As part of this spell&rsquo;s casting, you must cut one of your hands, releasing a stream of blood that causes you to take 1d6 points of damage. When you cast another spell in that same round, your blood transforms into one material component of your choice required by that second spell. Even valuable components worth more than 1 gp can be created, but creating such material components requires an additional cost of 1 point of Strength damage, plus a further point of damage for every full 500 gp of the component&rsquo;s value (so a component worth 500&ndash;999 gp costs a total of 2 points, 1,000&ndash;1,500 costs 3, etc.). You cannot create magic items with <i>blood money</i>.
</p>

<p>
For example, a sorcerer with the spell <i>stoneskin</i> prepared could cast <i>blood money</i> to create the 250 gp worth of diamond dust required by that spell, taking 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of Strength damage in the process.
</p>

<p>
Material components created by <i>blood money</i> transform back into blood at the end of the round if they have not been used as a material component. Spellcasters who do not have blood cannot cast <i>blood money</i>, and those who are immune to Strength damage (such as undead spellcasters) cannot use <i>blood money</i> to create valuable material components.

You cause the target to bleed from every orifice, and her organs and blood become suffused with positive energy. If the subject fails her Fortitude save, she takes 1d6 points of bleed damage per 4 caster levels (to a maximum of 4d6 at 16th level) when you cast this spell. Any creature that takes a full-round action to sup the blood of the bleeding subject heals a number of hit points equal to twice as many as the subject lost that round due to the bleed effect. The subject must be willing or helpless to sup her blood, which provokes attacks of opportunity. Only one creature can be healed in this way per round. The subject can lick her own wounds in this way to regain half as many hit points as she lost that round. If the bleeding effect is stopped or the spell&rsquo;s duration ends, the subject&rsquo;s blood no longer heals those who drink it, though in the latter case the subject continues to bleed until the bleeding is stopped via magical healing or a successful DC 15 Heal check.

If you have the blood casting class feature, you can cast this spell as a swift action instead of a standard action while you&rsquo;re in a bloodrage.

You greatly magnify the target&rsquo;s ability to smell the presence of blood. The target is considered to have the scent universal monster ability, but only for purposes of detecting and pinpointing injured creatures (below full hit points). Creatures below half their full hit points or suffering bleed damage are considered strong scents for this ability.
</p>

<p>
Orcs and any creature under the effects of rage gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures they can smell with this spell, or a +4 morale bonus if the target&rsquo;s blood counts as a strong scent.

After casting this spell, you pour a few drops of your blood and saliva into the mouth of the animal sculpture material component, temporarily giving it life. The animal is bonded to you as if it were a familiar, and it has the abilities of a familiar (use your caster level as your effective wizard level to determine its abilities), but it does not grant you the Alertness feat or the special ability of its animal type. If your blood sentinel is slain, you take 2 points of Intelligence drain and the blood sentinel&rsquo;s body becomes a destroyed statue. This spell has no effect if you already have a familiar or another blood sentinel.

As part of the casting, the caster must shed some of his blood (or an equivalent humor).

You smear a handful of your own blood across your chest, causing one writhing tentacle per caster level to burst forth. You can direct these tentacles to attack a single creature within 15 feet as a standard action, or one creature per 5 caster levels as a full-round action. Each tentacle has an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus plus either your Constitution or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher). Each tentacle deals 2d6 points of damage, and a tentacle collapses into dried blood on a successful hit, granting you a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. You can&rsquo;t gain more temporary hit points than your maximum number of hit points. These temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour.

One of the targets of this spell must be a hostage&mdash;a bound, pinned, or helpless creature within your reach (though the spell doesn&rsquo;t end if the hostage later moves beyond your reach). The second target must be a member of the first target&rsquo;s family. If neither creature successfully saves against the spell, the second target also takes any damage conferred to the hostage, provided both are still alive, to a maximum of 10 points of damage per caster level per day (damage beyond that necessary to kill the first target does not transfer). This transferred damage is typeless and ignores the second creature&rsquo;s damage reduction and resistances. If either target succeeds at the saving throw, you can never attempt to exploit the connection between these particular two creatures again. The connection between your targets weakens when the two are less familiar with one another. Each target gains a +2 bonus on its save if the two are distant relations or related by marriage. Each target takes a &minus;2 penalty on its save if the two targets are parent and child or siblings.

By consuming 1 pint of blood from a spellcaster killed within the last 24 hours, you can attempt to learn a spell that spellcaster knew. Select one spell available to the dead spellcaster (this must be a spell on your spell list); you gain the knowledge of this spell for 24 hours. During this time, you may write it down (or teach it to your familiar, if you are a witch) using the normal rules for copying a spell from another source.

Developed due to Arazni&rsquo;s fear that her stolen organs might be used to control her, this spell reflects any attempts to steal your free will. Whenever you are exposed to a mind-affecting effect or a spell that would otherwise give another creature control of your actions (such as <i>control undead</i>), you can dispel this effect as an immediate action to redirect the spell to a creature within 30 feet. The affected creature must attempt a save against the original DC of the triggering effect. On a failure, it is subject to the effects of the triggering spell, with the exception that you are treated as the original caster (statistics determined by caster level are still calculated according to its original caster). The target creature applies any spell resistance or immunities it has normally. You can have only one instance of this spell active at a time.

<p>
When you cast this spell, you cut yourself and swear an oath of retribution on your own blood. You decide how much damage you want to take from this attack, up to 25 points. This damage cannot be healed for as long as the spell is in effect. Anytime you perform an attack, save, or check that is directly related to the oath and brings you closer to the fulfillment of that oath, you gain a morale bonus to that roll equal to the number of hit points of damage you took from the oath divided by 5. The GM is the final arbiter over whether or not an action qualifies for this bonus. When you fulfill the oath (or choose to forsake it), the spell ends, and the lost hit points can be healed as normal.
</p>

For example, a notorious bandit leader killed Stigur&rsquo;s brother, and Stigur wants to avenge his brother&rsquo;s death. Stigur casts this spell and sacrifices 20 hit points. Thereafter Stigur gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls against the bandit leader&rsquo;s minions, saves against spells from said minions, Intimidate checks to coerce an informant to tell him where the bandit leader is camped, and so on.

This spell reduces all types of writing and other recognizable symbols found on any sort of surface within range into illegible smears. It affects books, carvings on stone, or even tattoos with equal ease. It does not affect writing that is not actually on a surface, such as an illusion, projection, reflection, or anything similar. Spellbooks and magical items that contain writing (such as scrolls) gain a saving throw to resist the effects of this spell. Against magical writing created by spell effects (such as <i>glyphs of warding</i> or symbols), blot instead functions as a <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i> spell capable of targeting all such spell effects in the area.

You gain a +3 bonus on the attack roll if your opponent is wearing metal armor, is carrying a metal weapon, or is made of metal. The target of your touch attack is dealt electricity damage equal to half the amount of electricity damage you took after you cast this spell (for example, if you saved for half damage against a <i>lightning bolt</i> and took only 15 points of electricity damage, your next touch attack deals 7 points of electricity damage). This spell is discharged once you hit with a melee touch attack to deliver its damage.

</p>

<p>
As long as the two targets are of the same size category, they are indistinguishable. As a consequence, if the targets are adjacent and a creature takes an action that would affect one of the targets (such as an attack, a targeted spell, or an area effect), that action has a 50% chance of affecting the other target instead.

This spell does not deceive creatures that have <i>true seeing</i>. Likewise, a creature that can&rsquo;t perceive one of the targets is not fooled by this spell (even if the spell fooled that creature earlier), and its attacks, targeted spells, and other actions affect targets as normal.

Choose a creature that you can see. When that creature is struck by a weapon wielded by a member of the Red Mantis, a sawtooth sabre, or by the claw of a giant mantis, the bone nearest to the wound instantly sprouts jagged, razor-sharp spurs that flense the muscle and flesh from the inside out unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. The creature takes 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level. While the bone returns to normal immediately after dealing damage, the creature takes 1d4 points of bleed damage for 1 round per 2 caster levels. The victim is sickened by the pain for the duration of the bleeding. If the target creature has no bones, this spell has no effect.

<p>
By using a bone fetish like a marionette, you take control of a target creature&rsquo;s skeleton. This has a variety of effects depending on whether the target is living or undead.
</p>

<p>
A living creature has its skeleton rattle within its flesh, causing it grievous harm. The target takes 3d6 points of damage, plus 1d6 additional points of damage per 2 caster levels you have.
</p>

<p>
In addition, you can move the target 5 feet. This movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the movement.
</p>

<p>
An undead creature takes no damage. Instead, you manipulate the undead, forcing it to take an immediate action to either move up to its speed (provoking attacks of opportunity as normal) or make a single attack against a creature of your choice in its reach. Either of these is the most basic version of the action the creature can take (it doesn&rsquo;t activate any special abilities that it could apply to the movement or attack, such as grab). A successful saving throw negates this effect. A mindless undead creature doesn&rsquo;t receive a save against this effect.

A creation of the archmage Nex, this spell allows you to reach ahead in time and draw alacrity from the future at the expense of your own health. For the duration of this spell, you gain an extra swift action you can use only during your turn.

Each time you take an extra swift action in this fashion you take 1 point of Constitution damage. If you&rsquo;re immune to ability damage, you take 5 points of hit point damage instead.

Anytime the target would take falling damage, it treats falls as 20 feet shorter (minimum 0) for the purpose of determining damage. In addition, if the target falls against a hard surface, it can attempt an Acrobatics check (DC = the distance fallen) to attempt to bounce upward; success means the creature bounces upward half the distance fallen.

You conjure a beautiful and delicious feast with hors d&rsquo;oeuvres, four courses worth of food, and plentiful drink. The food appears on ornate serving trays or in exquisite covered tureens, as appropriate to each type of dish. Place settings and serving utensils also appear&mdash;enough for each creature that will participate in the feast&mdash;along with elegant tablecloths and table linens. The spell doesn&rsquo;t create furniture, but the feast does adapt to appear on top of existing tables (or similar objects in the environment).
</p>

<p>
Though the feast and all the finery last only 1 hour, creatures that partake remain nourished and sated for 24 hours. Though you have little control over the fine details of the feast, you can specify what type of dish you want for each course and what sorts of beverages are provided. The feast automatically adjusts depending on the type of spellcaster you are. For instance, a druid casting this spell typically creates a spread of natural berries, whole roasted animals, and sweet (and possibly fermented) nectar for beverages, all on rough-hewn wooden plates with chopsticks instead of silverware and sizable leaves replacing napkins.

This spell etches the symbol of a nation, organization, or order on the target, dealing 1 point of damage. The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. While branded in this way, the recipient loses the ability to speak or understand its racial language and the language of its homeland or primary culture (if these are different). For example, an elf raised among the Shoanti would lose Elven and Shoanti (if she knew both those languages), while a halfling raised among dwarves would lose both Halfling and Dwarven (if she knew both those languages). A gnome raised among gnomes would lose Gnome, but no other language. This spell never suppresses Common or Undercommon, nor does it prevent spellcasting, though it may prevent a target from speaking intelligibly if it suppresses all of the target&rsquo;s languages. A brand of conformity can be hidden beneath clothing or removed by scraping it away (the latter deals 1d6 points of damage, though the brand returns if that damage is healed). In any event, the language-suppression element of a brand of conformity continues to function even when hidden or scraped away.

This spell etches the symbol of an eye or a lawful institution on the target, dealing 1d6 points of damage. The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. While the target is branded in this way, twice per day as a standard action, you can instantly determine in what direction and how far away the target is, as long as it is within a range equal to 1 mile per your caster level. If the target travels beyond this range or to another plane, you cannot gain information about the recipient&rsquo;s location. Similarly, if the target becomes warded by a spell or effect that thwarts divination spells (such as nondetection) or moves into such an area (such as one created by <i>antimagic field</i>), you cannot gain information about the target&rsquo;s location. This effect otherwise works as a <i>locate creature</i> spell that lasts for 1 minute per caster level. It can be fooled by <i>mislead</i> but not by <i>polymorph</i>. A <i>brand of tracking</i> can be hidden by clothing or temporarily removed by scraping it away (the latter deals 1d6 points of damage, though the brand returns if that damage is healed, or 1 day later otherwise).

In addition, a <i>greater brand</i> blazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened.
</p>

<p>
Like the effects of <i>bestow curse</i>, a <i>greater brand</i> cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a <i><a href="#Mark of Justice">mark of justice</a></i>.

This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. <i>Break enchantment</i> can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.
</p>

<p>
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>stone to flesh</i>, <i>break enchantment</i> works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
</p>

<p>
If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, <i>break enchantment</i> does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item&rsquo;s effects.

<p>
Unlike other spells that heal damage, <i>breath of life</i> can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature&rsquo;s hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature&rsquo;s hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through <i>breath of life</i> gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day.
</p>

<p>
Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by <i>breath of life</i>.
</p>

<p>
Like cure spells, <i>breath of life</i> deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.

This trademark spell of the Lantern Bearers functions as <i><a href="#Daylight">daylight</a></i>, except it lasts longer. In addition, as a swift action once during the spell&rsquo;s duration, you can will the light to try to end a magical darkness effect located within 60 feet of the light this spell emits. Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level), with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the darkness effect. If you succeed, the darkness effect ends. Regardless of whether you are successful, the light from this spell dims to the brightness of a torch for the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration.

You give a creature the ability to redirect a portion of its innate toughness away from its own defense and toward the amount of damage it deals with natural attacks. Each round, as a swift action at the start of its turn, the creature can choose to reduce some or all of its natural armor bonus to AC and gain an enhancement bonus on all damage rolls for natural attacks equal to that amount. The reduction to natural armor, and thus the enhancement bonus on damage rolls, cannot exceed 1 point per 3 caster levels, to a maximum penalty/bonus of &minus;5/+5 at 15th level. A creature cannot reduce its natural armor bonus to less than 0 with this spell.
</p>

<p>
All attacks directed against the creature use its adjusted AC until the start of its next turn, at which time it can choose to modify its AC again or keep it at its current level. Creatures make this decision without any need for conscious thought or reflection; even creatures with no Intelligence score can benefit from this spell, although they always opt for the maximum possible reduction and bonus, regardless of any tactical advantage they might lose.

You imbue a slashing melee weapon with the ability to deal a gruesome head wound. When the target weapon hits a living creature, in addition to the normal effects of that hit, the wielder can discharge this spell as a free action to open a gash on the target&rsquo;s forehead that deals bleed damage equal to half your caster level. At the start of each of the target&rsquo;s turns, when it takes bleed damage, it also takes a cumulative &minus;1 penalty on all attack rolls. When that penalty reaches &minus;3, the target also treats all targets as having concealment (20% miss chance). When the penalty reaches &minus;5, the target is blinded. Stopping the bleed damage ends the effects this spell imposes on the bleeding creature. A target that is immune to bleed damage is also immune to all this spell&rsquo;s effects.

You get a sense of the best way to interact with the target in order to encourage positive regard and fellowship toward you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks you attempt when interacting with the target. In addition, whenever you fail a Charisma check or Charisma-based skill check when interacting with the target, you can reroll the check as an immediate action. Attempting this reroll grants the target a new saving throw to end the spell. The target doesn&rsquo;t become hostile to you when the spell ends, but it does become disillusioned of its new trust in you. Attacking the target or taking an obvious hostile action against it automatically ends the spell.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the contacts rules, your trust score with the target increases by 1 for the duration of the spell. If you&rsquo;re using the individual influence system, if the target fails its initial saving throw you learn one of its influence skills, strengths, or weaknesses as though you had succeeded at a discovery check.

You toss several adamantine bullets into the air, which then hover protectively nearby and intercept firearm attacks targeting you. The number of bullets protecting you is equal to half your caster level (maximum 4). When an opponent takes a shot at you with a firearm, as an immediate action you can designate a hovering bullet to attempt to block the attack, increasing your AC against that attack by 10. Doing this destroys the adamantine bullet whether or not the attack hits. The spell is discharged when all affected adamantine bullets are destroyed or taken from you. Each adamantine bullet has AC 24, 20 hit points, and hardness 20.

</p>

<p>
This spell causes an arc of flame to leap from your fingers, burning a number of enemies nearby. It deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). For every additional target the discharge arcs to, reduce the number of damage dice by half (rounded down). Therefore, at 9th level, your <i>burning arc</i> deals 9d6 points of fire damage to the primary target, then 4d6 points of fire damage to a secondary target, then 2d6 points of fire damage to an additional target.
</p>

<p>
Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You may choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 15 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

This spell causes a metal object to instantly become red hot. A creature holding the item may attempt a Reflex save to drop it and take no damage (even if it is not their turn), otherwise the hot metal deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4). Circumstances that prevent the creature from dropping the item (such as a locked gauntlet) mean the creature gets no saving throw. The heat does not harm the item, and it does not get hot enough or last long enough to ignite flammable objects. The item cools to its previous temperature almost instantly. If cast underwater, burning disarm deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.

This spell functions as per <i><a href="#Entangle">entangle</a></i>, except it sets the foliage on fire. A creature that begins its turn entangled by the spell takes 4d6 points of fire damage (Reflex half), and a creature that begins its turn in the area but is not entangled takes 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex negates). Smoke rising from the vines partially obscures visibility. Creatures can see things in the smoke within 5 feet clearly, but attacks against anything farther away in the smoke must contend with concealment (20% miss chance). When the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, the vines burn away entirely.

Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.
</p>

<p>
As a standard action as long as this spell&rsquo;s effects persist, you may direct your <i>burning gaze</i> against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire.
</p>

<p>
Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from <i>burning gaze</i>.
</p>

<p>
Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack&mdash;foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze.

You cause sheets of hot sand to spread over the ground in the area of effect. This layer of sand is 1 foot deep and constantly shifts and churns, transforming the ground in the area into difficult terrain. The sand itself burns, and periodic flames rise from the grit. While these flames cannot ignite objects, they deal 1d4 points of fire damage to any creature that ends its turn in contact with the ground within the area of effect. At the end of the duration, the sand vanishes, leaving no aftereffects (other than damage dealt).

The subject can <i>burrow</i> at a speed of 15 feet (or 10 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load) through sand, loose soil, or gravel, or at a speed of 5 feet through stone. Using <i>burrow</i> requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The burrowing creature cannot charge or run. Loose material collapses behind the target 1 round after it leaves the area. This spell does not give the target the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through loose material, the creature must hold its breath and take only short trips, or else it may suffocate.

You can also target a creature that is grappling or otherwise restraining you (such as by adhesive or the swallow whole ability) with the spell. You don&rsquo;t need to make a touch attack to use <i>burst bonds</i> against a creature, and you can cast this spell without making a concentration check while grappled or pinned. The creature does not take damage as above. If you are grappled and your target fails its save, you may make an immediate attempt to break the grapple (but not reverse it) as a free action, with a +1 luck bonus to your CMB per caster level (maximum +5). If the target creature fails its save and you are restrained by an ability that originally allowed a saving throw, <i>burst bonds</i> allows a new saving throw with a +1 luck bonus per two caster levels (maximum +5).

The target becomes filled with intense magical light, taking 2d6 points of damage as the light bursts from its wounds and orifices (if the target is an undead creature, it instead takes 2d8 points of damage). In addition, the creature radiates bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area&mdash;darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 30-foot radius of this magical light. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the light effect.
</p>

<p>
For every 4 character levels you possess, the light continues to fill the creature for another round (to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level), though the target may make a Will save each round to halve the damage and end the effect. Any creature adjacent to the target that fails its save and takes damage takes half as much damage and is blinded for 1 round. A successful Reflex save halves this damage (to a total of one-quarter the damage taken by the target) and negates the blindness effect.

<p>
Upon drinking an extract created with this formulae, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract&rsquo;s duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae with the word &ldquo;bomb admixture&rdquo; in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active.
</p>

<p>
When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, it creates an invisible cubical prison composed of a solid wall of force.
</p>

<p>
The prison is as large as the splash area of the bomb that you threw, and traps any creature that is entirely inside the area.
</p>

<p>
Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless any creature within the splash radius is too big to fit inside, in which case the effect automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide means for escape, but the force walls extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
</p>

<p>
Like a wall of force, the cage created by the caging bomb admixture resists dispel magic, although a mage&rsquo;s disjunction still functions. The walls of the cage can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys the cage. The walls of this cage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but the cage has a hardness of 20 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per alchemist level.
</p>

<p>
Contact with a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation instantly destroys this cage.
</p>

<p>
When using caging bomb admixture, an alchemist can only have one cage in effect at a time. If the alchemist throws another bomb during the duration of caging bomb admixture, any other cage created by the earlier admixture ends, and a new one is created. When the duration of the caging bomb admixture ends, so does any remaining cage created by this admixture&rsquo;s effect.

You cause the victim&rsquo;s attacks to careen wildly, endangering itself and those around it. Your target gains a 25% miss chance on all attack rolls. If an attack misses due to this magical effect, the victim instead targets an ally, or else itself if there are no allies within range of the original attack. Apply the attack roll for the original attack to the new target&rsquo;s Armor Class to determine if this attack hits. This is a curse effect.

Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. <i>Break enchantment</i>, <i>restoration</i>, <i>or stone to flesh</i> can reverse the effects of <i>calcific touch</i>.

You summon a wasp swarm that builds a 10-foot-by-10-foot nest in the place you designate&mdash;typically under the eaves of a house, amid the rafters of a tavern, or in another obscured place. The wasp swarm takes the spell&rsquo;s casting time to build its nest; if the swarm is disrupted in any way (such as by being attacked) before you finish casting this spell, the wasps disappear and the spell fizzles.
</p>

<p>
Once the wasp swarm has built its nest, this spell also wards the area. As per <i>alarm</i>, when intruders that do not speak the password pass within 20 feet, the swarm is alerted and immediately leaves its nest and attacks the nearest intruder. The swarm pursues that intruder as best it can. Once the swarm attacks an intruder, you have no control over its target or direction of travel. When the spell ends, if the wasps have not left their nest, they and their nest disappear.

<p>
This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you designate (provided the animal&rsquo;s CR is equal to or less than your caster level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrivedepends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within the spell&rsquo;s duration, you are aware of this fact, but the spell is wasted. Knowledge of the local fauna makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a Knowledge (nature) skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area.
</p>

<p>
When the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet of you and remains nearby for the duration of the spell.
</p>

<p>
Its starting attitude is indifferent, modified by circumstances and interaction. Other than starting attitude, this spell gives you no special influence or ability to communicate with the called animal, although you may use other spells or abilities to do so.
</p>

<p>
Once the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with its attitude. Most animals will likely wander off, but a hostile predatory animal may attack, especially if it is hungry or provoked.
</p>

<p>
Domesticated animals or animals trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars or animal companions, are unaffected by <i>call animals</i>.

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell&rsquo;s range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.
</p>

<p>
You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).
</p>

<p>
If you are outdoors and in a stormy area&mdash;a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)&mdash;each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.

You attempt to cause the spirit of a specific individual to manifest from its final resting place. You must request the spirit&rsquo;s presence by speaking its name.

<p>
Unwilling spirits can resist the summons by succeeding at a Will save. If the chosen spirit resists your call, another spirit with malevolent intent almost always takes its place, intent on deceiving you. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to the creature whose spirit you wish to call.

A successfully called spirit manifests as a wispy, vaporous form that vaguely resembles the form the deceased creature had in life. The spirit has the physical attributes of an <i><a href="#Unseen Servant">unseen servant</a></i> and is capable of minor physical manipulations, with the ability to speak in quiet, ghostly whispers in whatever languages the creature knew while it was alive. The spirit isn&rsquo;t an undead creature, and isn&rsquo;t beholden to its caller.
</p>

<p>
Whether you summoned the chosen spirit or a deceitful replacement, the spirit can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you using Bluff, though in either case these spirits can speak about only what they knew in life and have no knowledge of events that occurred after their deaths.
</p>

<p>
Malevolent spirits might take advantage of their limited physical abilities to cause terrifying spectacles designed to scare the caster.
</p>

<p>
You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (as a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. You can ask a total of one question per caster level; the spirit answers each during the same round. When the spell ends, the spirit&rsquo;s ectoplasmic form fades and the soul returns to its rest. This spell can&rsquo;t call the spirits of creatures that are currently undead.

This spell first rose to prominence among the elves of Kyonin in the war to retake their ancestral land from the demon lord Treerazer and his minions. Elite units of elven magi entered battle with this spell prepared to shield fallen comrades or stand firm against fell foes. As the elven presence returned to the world, this spell spread throughout the Inner Sea and beyond.
</p>

<p>
When you cast this spell, you cause a weapon wielded by an ally within 30 feet to telekinetically fly across the space between you and into your open hand. This extra energy persists in the weapon for the rest of the round, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made during the same round you cast this spell.

If the ally targeted for this spell is unwilling to give up her weapon, the spell fails. An unconscious or dying ally is considered a &ldquo;willing&rdquo; target so long as the weapon to be called is still in contact with the ally&rsquo;s body.

This spell calms the air and disperses fog, dust, and other particles. The wind force in the area is reduced in strength by one step per 4 caster levels (to a minimum wind force of light) and clouds are dispersed, although parts of nonmagical clouds that extend beyond the area are not affected. If a magical cloud or wind&rsquo;s point of origin is inside the area of a <i>calm air</i> spell, the whole effect is suppressed; otherwise, only the part inside the area is suppressed. Suppression still counts against the duration of a wind or cloud effect. Magical wind and cloud effects are suppressed only if you succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + effect&rsquo;s caster level). You can move the <i>calm air</i> effect by concentrating as a standard action.

This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but <i>calm emotions</i> can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.

<p>
This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as <i>bless</i>, <i>good hope</i>, and <i>rage</i>, and also negates a bard&rsquo;s ability to inspire courage or a barbarian&rsquo;s rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell, condition, or effect has no effect. When the <i>calm emotions spell</i> ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

<p>
This spell temporarily calms agitated haunts and incorporeal undead such as ghosts. You have no control over the affected creatures, but <i>calm spirit</i> postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for the duration of the spell. Entities so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, including triggering persistent haunt abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately ends the effect.
</p>

<p>
Haunts do not receive a saving throw against the spell, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check whose difficulty is equal to at least 10 + the haunt&rsquo;s CR in order to temporarily calm the angry entity. The spell&rsquo;s duration changes to concentration (up to 1 round/level) when affecting a haunt.

You can create a barrier around a fire of at least campfire size that shelters everyone inside so long as the fire continues to burn. The barrier appears as a crackling sphere of light and fire that is clearly visible, providing as much illumination as a torch.
</p>

<p>
The barrier bocks line of sight, granting creatures on either side of the barrier total concealment from creatures on the other side. Any object or creature passing through the barrier from outside takes 1d6 points of fire damage and is also outlined with light equivalent to that of a torch, for 1d6 minutes. Creatures outlined in this way are plainly visible regardless of the light conditions and do not benefit from any sort of concealment, magical or otherwise. The light is not bright enough to have any special effect on undead or creatures vulnerable to light.
</p>

<p>
Creatures inside the barrier can leave without penalty, but if they try to return they suffer the same consequences as anyone else. If the fire source at the barrier&rsquo;s center is extinguished or moved, the spell ends.

This spell eviscerates the target, drawing forth its life essence as well as its internal organs. The target takes 1d6 hit points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). If this damage kills the target, the spell pulls the creature&rsquo;s organs into a set of 4 canopic jars and seals them; 1d4 rounds later, the corpse revives as a mummy (if 8 HD or fewer) or an advanced mummy (if 9 HD or more).
</p>

<p>
The mummy is not under your control, but the canopic jars give the bearer certain powers over it. Anyone holding one of the jars can communicate with the mummy as if the two shared a common language. The bearer gains the benefits of <i>protection from evil</i> and <i>sanctuary</i>, but only against that mummy. Unsealing or breaking a jar is a standard action, which dissipates its power (and protection) but lets the bearer issue a short command to the mummy, similar to a <i>suggestion</i> spell (Will DC 23 negates). You (and only you) may unseal all 4 jars in a 10-minute ritual to control the mummy with an similar to <i>geas</i> (Will DC 23 negates); most casters typically include a restriction that the mummy will not harm them, as unsealing the jars leaves them vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
The pharaohs of ancient Osirion sometimes used this spell to punish their enemies. The Risen Guard does not use the spell (though they have access to it), preferring trustworthy living guardians for the Ruby Prince. The Whispering Way may have copies of the spell.

You summon a wasp swarm, which fills your space (up to 5 feet by 5 feet) but does not attack you. The dense cloud of vermin gives you partial concealment against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 points of swarm damage and poison from the wasp swarm, but is not affected by the swarm&rsquo;s distraction ability. As a free action on your turn, you may have the swarm cling to you tightly, giving you a fly speed of 20 feet (poor maneuverability); when using the swarm to fly, it does not provide concealment or harm creatures that strike you. You can return the swarm to its protective shape as a free action on your turn.

<p>
You animate one of the target&rsquo;s fetid organs so that it leads you to the undead creature&rsquo;s most recent controller or the cause of the creature&rsquo;s undeath.
</p>

<p>
The organ (typically the heart, the brain, or an eyeball) floats in front of you at chest level and slowly leads you to the undead creature&rsquo;s most recent controller at a rate of 30 feet per round, always staying within your range of vision. If the creature from which the organ originated had no controller, but rather was created deliberately by another creature, the organ instead leads you to that creator.
</p>

<p>
If the undead was animated by an effect or event at a particular location, the organ leads you to that location.
</p>

<p>
If the creature was animated by none of the methods above, if it was self-created, or if the creature&rsquo;s most recent controller no longer exists, the spell fails. Once the organ is within 10 feet of its intended destination, the spell ends, and the organ falls to the ground.
</p>

<p>
The organ cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from leading you to its intended target. It may pass through small slits and crevices, though it will not leave your range of vision. The organ cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot where you cast the spell. If the undead creature to which the organ belonged is destroyed, the spell ends and the organ falls to the ground.

You touch an animal or magical beast that has a helpful attitude toward you, instantly transforming the creature into a miniature figurine of stone, small enough to fit into the palm of your hand. Creatures with an attitude of less than helpful will not tolerate this spell, and it automatically fails to work on them.
</p>

<p>
An intelligent animal or magical beast must be a willing subject in order for this spell to take effect. Any items that the creature wears (such as a harness or saddle) or carries (such as those stowed in saddlebags) are transformed along with the creature.
</p>

<p>
While miniaturized, the creature is under an effect similar to that of a <i>flesh to stone</i> spell: It is mindless and inert, and does not seem alive when viewed with spells like <i>deathwatch</i>. However, you may return the creature to its normal form at any time simply by placing the figurine on the ground, touching it, and uttering a word of command. Otherwise, the creature remains in miniature form unless the spell is broken, such as by <i>dispel magic</i> or stronger magic. Unlike a <i>flesh to stone</i> spell, a creature affected by <i>carry companion</i> is unaffected by <i>stone to flesh</i>. If the miniature figurine is broken or damaged, the creature (if returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities.

With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check against any <i>magic jar</i> effect (including a ghost&rsquo;s malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i> spell, except <i>cast out</i> can dispel one such spell for every four caster levels you possess. A successful Will save halves the damage and limits the dispelling to a single spell or effect.

You create a magical trap in the area that causes deadly stalactites or stalagmites to lurch out of the floor or ceiling of a stone surface to &ldquo;bite&rdquo; an intruder. The magical trap is triggered whenever a Small or larger creature (other than you or your animal companion, familiar, or spirit animal) moves through the affected area. The effect of <i>cave fangs</i> depends on whether you create stalactites or stalagmites; see below. You can place these trapped squares anywhere within the spell&rsquo;s range; they need not be adjacent to each other, and you can create any mix of stalactites and stalagmites you wish. Cave fangs can be detected and disarmed as per a magical trap with successful DC 30 Perception and Disable Device checks. All trapped squares created by a single casting are linked, and they are all disabled if one of them is. If you place the traps in an area that is occupied by a creature, the spell effect is triggered at the completion of the casting.

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Stalactites:
	<td>	Shards of rock drop from the ceiling, dealing 3d8 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex half) and creating an area of dense rubble that costs 2 squares of movement to enter. Dense rubble adds 5 to the DC of Acrobatics checks and adds 2 to the DCs of Stealth checks. A creature that fails its Reflex save is pinned to the ground under stalactites and rubble, gaining the entangled condition until it can free itself with a successful DC 15 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. One Small or larger creature can automatically clear the rubble by working for 1 minute.
<tr>
	<th>	Stalagmites:
	<td>	Piercing spires of rock erupt up from the ground, dealing 3d8 points of piercing damage and knocking the creature prone (a creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and avoids being knocked prone). Once the stalagmites appear, they function thereafter as spike stones for 1 minute per caster level and then crumble to dust.
</table>

<p>
If <i>cave fangs</i> is cast inside of a cave or cavern, each effect of the spell deals 4d8 points of damage instead of 3d8, and creatures that trigger the <i>cave fangs</i> take a &minus;2 penalty on their saving throws against the spell&rsquo;s effect.

<p>
You harness divine power to create one of four different ceremonies&mdash;a funeral, holiday fete, marriage, or naming&mdash;and can also create two domain-based ceremonies. Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the downtime system from <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i>, you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. <i>Augmented</i> boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Unless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a creature&rsquo;s highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has no caster level, CL 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your caster level to do so.
</ul>
	<li>	<b>Funeral:</b> A funeral service must involve a corpse and at least one willing companion or next of kin. The subject gains a +2 sacred bonus against death effects.
	<li>	<b>Holiday Fete:</b> A holiday fete may involve up to two willing creatures. The subject gains a +1 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves.
	<li>	<b>Marriage:</b> A marriage must involve two willing creatures. The subject gains a +1 sacred bonus on saves against fear and emotion effects.
	<li>	<b>Naming:</b> A naming must involve a willing parent or parents and a newborn (who is touched but unaffected). The subject can use <i>sanctuary</i> once.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The augmented versions of these four ceremonies are identical, granting the subject a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these four ceremonies, each cleric gains two more ceremonies according to her domain. The names of domain ceremonies and their relevant boons are listed below. Unless otherwise noted, each of the following ceremonies requires at least two willing subjects.

<p>
This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>chain lightning</i> strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.
</p>

<p>
The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt.
</p>

<p>
Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage.
</p>

<p>
The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

<p>
A floating chain of force with hooks at each end appears within an unoccupied space of your choosing within range. This chain is a Medium object that has a 10-foot reach. Physical attacks cannot hit or harm the chain of perdition, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it normally. The chain&rsquo;s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric).
</p>

<p>
The chain can perform the dirty trick (blind or entangle), drag, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, using your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The chain does not provoke attacks of opportunity for making combat maneuvers. It suffers no penalty or miss chance due to darkness, invisibility, or other forms of concealment.

<p>
As a move action, you can move the chain up to 30 feet. If the chain goes beyond the spell&rsquo;s range or out of your sight, it returns to you.
</p>

<p>
If a creature that the chain attacks has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the chain performs a successful maneuver against that creature. If the chain is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treant-like creature, about 24 feet tall.
</p>

<p>
When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant.
</p>

<p>
The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands.
</p>

<p>
However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.

This spell makes a creature more charitable, compelling it to aid others rather than use violence.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
An affected creature practices nonviolent combat behaviors according to the following list of priorities, beginning with the first priority. The subject continues to perform a priority until he can no longer fulfill its demands (at which point he moves to the next priority) or until the spell ends, whichever comes first.
<ul>
	<li>	<b>1st Priority</b>: Heal injured creatures within 30 feet, beginning with the closest creatures and using whatever methods the subject has at hand (including potions, spells, and so on).
	<li>	<b>2nd Priority</b>: The subject gives his weapon away to the nearest creature within 30 feet who will accept it. If no creature accepts the weapon, the subject drops the weapon on the ground.
	<li>	<b>3rd Priority</b>: Cast beneficial spells and/or use beneficial magic items (including potions, wands, and so on) on creatures within 30 feet, starting with the closest creatures.
	<li>	<b>4th Priority</b>: The subject gives away his non-worn possessions&mdash;the contents of a backpack or similar item count as one item each, as does the container itself&mdash;to creatures within 30 feet. If no creature accepts the items, the subject drops the items on the ground.
	<li>	<b>5th Priority</b>: The subject gives away his remaining possessions (including his armor, boots, cloak, and so on) to creatures within 30 feet. If no creature accepts the items, the subject drops them on the ground.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If the subject fulfills all five priorities, the spell effect ends. The subject cannot attack or take attacks of opportunity, but can defend himself as normal. If the subject is attacked, the spell&rsquo;s effect immediately ends.

This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target&rsquo;s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.
</p>

<p>
The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person&rsquo;s language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

By sacrificing a living creature, you create the grisly illusion of viscera and gore splattered about the nearby area. When the casting time is complete, the walls drip with blood and the floor is slick with unidentifiable lumps of meat and other signs of a massacre. Anyone entering the area must attempt a Will save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can see the semi-real nature of the illusion.
</p>

<p>
The room itself is covered in a layer of slippery, semi-real gore. Any creature attempting to walk within or through the area of gore can move at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can&rsquo;t move that round, and failure by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that don&rsquo;t move on their turns don&rsquo;t need to attempt this check and are not considered flat-footed. A creature that succeeded at its Will save gains a +5 bonus on the Acrobatics check.

A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it&rsquo;s not wearing or wielding such an item.

<p>
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell&rsquo;s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below.

A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage.

You create a magical emanation that interferes with all figments and glamers within it, giving creatures a +4 bonus on saving throws to recognize them as illusions. The emanation negates concealment less than total concealment within the area. Perception checks to notice creatures or objects within the area gain a bonus equal to half your caster level (maximum +10). The spell is stationary if cast on a point in space. It is mobile if centered on a creature or object, though creatures or attended objects can negate the spell with a saving throw or spell resistance.

<i>Clairaudience/clairvoyance</i> creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don&rsquo;t need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known&mdash;a place familiar to you, or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn&rsquo;t move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell&rsquo;s effect. <i>Clairaudience/clairvoyance</i> functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.

The subject of this spell gains two benefits. First, the affected creature gains the ability to create a sound like the blast of a mighty horn or trumpet simply by miming the action of sounding one. Second, the subject can speak in a booming voice that carries easily over great distances, lowering the DC of any check to hear what is said by &minus;15. This spell is particularly prized by battlefield commanders and champions who wish to make themselves clearly heard or gain the attention of their allies or foes.

You create two Colossal-sized masses of rock, dirt, and stone and slam them together against a single creature between them. The <i>clashing rocks</i> appear up to 30 feet away from the target on opposite sides and rush toward it with a mighty grinding crash. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target with the rocks. The <i>clashing rocks</i> ignore concealment and cover, and if there is a solid barrier between the target and either of the <i>clashing rocks</i>, the spell has a +28 bonus on the Strength check to burst through the barrier and continue unimpeded to the target. A creature struck by the <i>clashing rocks</i> takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the target fails a Reflex saving throw, it is also buried under the resulting rubble as if by a cave-in.
</p>

<p>
If the <i>clashing rocks</i> miss the target, the target still takes 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage from falling rocks and is knocked prone. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage to half and the target remains standing. Creatures other than the target that occupy the spaces where the <i>clashing rocks</i> appear or within their path (30 feet wide, 30 feet high, and up to 60 feet long) must also make Reflex saves or take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (save for half and remain standing).

Trees, shrubs, and other thick vegetation move out of the spell&rsquo;s area. The affected area is cleared of all vegetation thick enough to provide cover or concealment.

The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.
</p>

<p>
The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively) + 11 for the hand&rsquo;s Strength score (33), &minus;1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save (against this spell&rsquo;s save DC) or be stunned for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

You cause a thick, sturdy beanstalk to sprout from the ground and grow upward to a height of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. The growing stalk anchors itself to sturdy objects such as walls or ceilings, and grows around objects that do not fully obstruct its square (such as tree branches), but is stopped by solid obstacles. The beanstalk provides numerous hand- and footholds; its climb DC 5. The beanstalk can support up to 200 pounds plus 50 pounds per caster level, or double that amount if anchored on its upper end. If it anchors itself to a sturdy mobile object (such as a ship or a siege engine), breaking the object free requires a DC 23 Strength check or cutting through the beanstalk (hardness 2, 40 hp).
</p>

<p>
If the ground is capable of supporting plant life, the beanstalk continues to live as a normal plant, and it produces nutritious (if unappetizing) beans. Otherwise, the plant dies after 1d6 hours; its husk remains as durable as a small tree.

A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become confused. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <i>protection from law</i>, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.

Creatures with the scent special quality have a &minus;4 penalty on their saves.

This spell forms an invisible bubble that filters all speech coming from inside the affected area so that creatures outside hear a completely different version of the conversation. The bubble also disguises lip movements to match the false conversation. Any creature listening to the conversation for at least 1 round can attempt a DC 15 Sense Motive check to realize that the apparent conversation doesn&rsquo;t actually make any sense. The bubble also obscures the verbal components of spells cast within the area so it&rsquo;s impossible to identify spells by their verbal components alone, and anyone outside the bubble attempting a Spellcraft check to identify a spell cast within the bubble takes a &minus;5 penalty on the check. Furthermore, the bubble renders any language-dependent spells and effects used within the bubble ineffective against creatures outside the area.

This spell provides the subject with some degree of protection from the harmful effects of the sun. The cloaked subject treats environmental heat due to sun exposure as one level less: severe heat is considered very hot conditions, while very hot is considered average temperature. The <i>cloak of shade</i> also reduces any penalties from sunlight by 1. The spell does not, however, eliminate the effects of direct sunlight on creatures vulnerable to sunlight. <i>Cloak of shade</i> has no effect on environmental heat from sources other than the sun.

You wrap yourself in a protective mantle of semi-real shadow. This grants a number of advantages: you gain concealment (20% miss chance), a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks, and DR 5/good. This shroud of shadows also protects you from direct sunlight, negating sunlight vulnerability, sunlight powerlessness, and similar effects.
</p>

<p>
When you are in dim light or darkness, the first two benefits increase against foes that don&rsquo;t have darkvision or the see in darkness ability.

You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind. The subject is never checked or blown away by strong winds of windstorm or lesser strength (whether natural or magically created), and ranged attack rolls against the subject take a &minus;4 penalty. Tiny or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save to successfully touch or attack the subject in melee. Failure knocks the attacker prone and pushes it 5 feet away from the subject per level of the caster. This movement can pass through the squares of other creatures without affecting them and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but the creature takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage, plus 1d6 if the creature strikes a solid object that blocks its movement.

<p>
This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original&rsquo;s physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.
</p>

<p>
To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature&rsquo;s living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.
</p>

<p>
When the clone is completed, the original&rsquo;s soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical to the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including its gaining of two permanent negative levels, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be cloned). If the original creature gained permanent negative levels since the flesh sample was taken, the clone gains these negative levels as well.
</p>

<p>
The spell duplicates only the original&rsquo;s body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots if not preserved.

This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a <i><a href="#Fog Cloud">fog cloud</a></i>, except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save).
</p>

<p>
A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).
</p>

<p>
A living creature with more than 6 HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding one&rsquo;s breath doesn&rsquo;t help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.
</p>

<p>
Unlike a <i>fog cloud</i>, the <i>cloudkill</i> moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.
</p>

<p>
Figure out the cloud&rsquo;s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.

Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

Upon casting this spell, all recipients gain the ability to speak a new language. This language sounds like random, babbling syllables to anyone not under the influence of the spell, but the targets understand each other perfectly.

Anyone using <i>codespeak</i> can read and write in this new language as well. Once the spell expires, however, any coded writing suddenly appears as gibberish. If the exact same group of individuals become the targets of a <i>codespeak</i> spell again, cast by the same caster, they can once again read any coded writings. A dedicated codebreaker can crack such writing&rsquo;s code, deciphering it one page at a time with a series of DC 30 Linguistics checks.

<i>Comprehend languages</i> doesn&rsquo;t enable a caster to understand the language of another&rsquo;s <i>codespeak</i> spell, but it does reveal that the targets are speaking a magical language. <i>Tongues</i> translates <i>codespeak</i> normally.

You create a mental block in the target&rsquo;s mind, impeding the flow of his mental spellcasting process and forcing him to incorporate a thought component into any spell or spell-like ability he uses.

Spell-like abilities require this thought component, even though they normally don&rsquo;t need spell components.

You turn up to three coins into deadly projectiles that gain the velocity of a bullet when thrown. The coins retain their normal appearance but can be used as simple thrown weapons with a range increment of 20 feet and a critical multiplier of &times;2. The transmuted coins are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them. Like firearm bullets, the coins deal bludgeoning and piercing damage, and attacks with them are resolved as touch attacks within the first range increment. Regardless of whether a transmuted coin hits or misses the target, it is destroyed after the attack. Only you can make attacks with the coins, though other creatures can safely handle them without discharging the spell.
</p>

<p>
You can make a single ranged attack with a coin as part of casting this spell. Different types of coins create different bullet effects. Copper coins deal 1d4 points of damage. Silver coins deal 1d6 points of damage and count as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Gold coins deal 1d8 points of damage and count as masterwork weapons. Platinum coins deal 1d10 points of damage, count as masterwork weapons, and are treated as adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. All coin bullets deal an additional 1 point of damage per 2 caster levels (to a maximum of an extra 10 points of damage at 20th level).

This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as friendly). They will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

<p>
This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead creature. If the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions favorably (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. Retries are not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.
</p>

<p>
A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &ldquo;come here,&rdquo; &ldquo;go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;stand still,&rdquo; and so on. Nonintelligent undead won&rsquo;t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.
</p>

<p>
Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell.
</p>

<p>
Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.

<p>
You contact your deity&mdash;or agents thereof&mdash;and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity&rsquo;s knowledge. &ldquo;Unclear&rdquo; is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity&rsquo;s interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.
</p>

<p>
The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.

You utter a question in the form of a low-pitched bird call that can be heard up to a mile away, and can understand the responses given by birds in the area. Over the next 10 minutes, the birds reply as if you had asked them the question using <i><a href="#Speak with Animals">speak with animals</a></i>, giving you a general consensus answer to the question based on their knowledge. For example, you could ask if there is drinkable water in the area, the location of predators or other creatures, directions to a mountaintop or other natural feature, and so on, and the local bird communities would answer to the best of their ability.

<p>
If there are no birds in range, the spell has no effect and you do not get a response. Any creature using <i>speak with animals</i> (or a similar ability) who hears this bird call can understand your question, though it may not be able to reply in a way you can hear.

You quickly absorb the knowledge in the target, which can be any assortment of books, scrolls, or other texts. During the spell&rsquo;s duration, you can search the texts and immediately find the most relevant information regarding any topic the collection holds, potentially including singling out spellbooks or scrolls containing individual or particular types of spells. You can attempt Knowledge checks related to the collection&rsquo;s topics as if you were trained in those skills, and you know whether the collection contains any information about which you failed a Knowledge check in the past 24 hours. The bonus on Knowledge checks granted by the collection of texts (if any) increases by 2.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, you always deplete the maximum number of knowledge points from a library whenever you succeed at a Research check using the target texts while this spell is in effect, even if completing the Research check takes longer than this spell lasts. Once during the duration of this spell, for a number of minutes equal to your caster level, you can also speak with the texts about anyone who has read or handled them previously, as per <i><a href="#Stone Tell">stone tell</a></i>.

You deliver a confusing but fascinating monologue, relaying conspiracies or metaphysical revelations that confound your audience, throughout the spell&rsquo;s casting time and as long as you concentrate. You take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain when you begin the speech and can&rsquo;t reduce or prevent this damage in any way. Each intelligent creature in the spell&rsquo;s area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell&rsquo;s duration. Listeners with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation. Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a &minus;4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them. You can&rsquo;t force beliefs on a target if such beliefs would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs.
</p>

<p>
If your campaign uses the sanity system, your sanity score decreases by 2 (and thus your sanity edge decreases by 1) instead of taking Wisdom drain each time you cast this spell. Only <i>greater restoration</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> can remove this decrease. A single casting of <i>greater restoration</i> removes one decrease in sanity from casting <i>compelling rant</i>, while a casting of <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> removes them all. Affected targets take sanity damage equal to half your caster level (maximum 10) instead of Wisdom damage. The targets might actually change alignment and beliefs if their loss of sanity afflicts them with an appropriate madness, in which case those effects last even after the spell&rsquo;s duration has ended.

This spell allows affected creatures to hold their breath freely without negative effects or risk of suffocation. Divide the duration evenly among all creatures touched. A creature that doesn&rsquo;t need to breathe because of this spell is not at risk of drowning and is immune to effects that require breathing, such as inhaled poisons. This does not grant immunity to cloud or gas attacks that don&rsquo;t require breathing. While a creature is holding its breath, it can&rsquo;t speak or cast spells with a verbal component (unless it&rsquo;s using Silent Spell). This spell does not prevent a creature from breathing normally; it just removes the need for the creature to breathe.

You condense the substance of the Ethereal Plane as it interpenetrates the Material Plane. This thickened planar conjunction slows movement through the area to a crawl.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Bestow Curse">bestow curse</a></i>, except that you must state a condition under which the curse is broken, ending its effect. An intelligent target, even one of animal intelligence, innately understands this condition even if it doesn&rsquo;t understand your language. The condition must be possible for the target to bring about within a year and a day without ensuring its own death and stated in 25 or fewer words. The curse is more difficult to remove via magic. The DC to remove <i>conditional curse</i> with <i>break enchantment</i> or <i>remove curse</i> increases by 5.

<p>
You must cast this spell immediately before casting another spell on the same creature, eliciting a promise or warning against a behavior and binding the target to the paired spell. If you don&rsquo;t cast a paired spell, <i>conditional favor</i> has no effect. The paired spell must be from the abjuration, conjuration (healing), enchantment, or transmutation school or subschool, and must be cast on a willing creature. If the spell&rsquo;s recipient violates the oath or prohibition while <i>conditional favor</i> remains in effect, the paired spell is undone as if never cast. If the spell was a healing spell, the hit point damage or condition you removed returns immediately, even if the subject has enjoyed subsequent rest or healing. Poisons, diseases, curses, restored ability damage, and negative levels removed by the paired spell return as well.
</p>

<p>
<i>Conditional favor</i> recognizes the spirit of your condition and doesn&rsquo;t trigger a violation due to unintended consequences or circumstances that the subject could not predict with her current knowledge of the situation. For instance, if the prohibition prevented the subject from laying a finger on royalty, touching a disguised prince would not count as a violation if the subject did not recognize the prince, nor would touching a member of royalty while dominated. The subject of the spell intuitively knows beforehand whether an action will cause it to lose the paired spell&rsquo;s benefit.

Note that a confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).

You create a fine wooden carriage with whatever cosmetic embellishments you desire. It is well constructed, although not exceptionally ostentatious. The carriage can carry up to six Medium or Small passengers. When conjured, the carriage comes with a team of two quasi-real light horses, which are already harnessed to the carriage. At your command, an invisible coachman similar to an <i><a href="#Unseen Servant">unseen servant</a></i> can assume the role of driver and direct the carriage, although it can&rsquo;t perform any complex or dangerous driving, and fails any checks made to drive the carriage in such conditions. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the carriage, horses, and coachman disappear into nothingness, depositing everything on or in it on the ground in its space.

You conjure a large metal cube covered in sharp spikes. If you conjure the block so that it appears in midair, it immediately plummets downward onto all creatures below it. When you cast this spell, you select the size of the square area you wish it to affect. If you choose to create a deadfall over a single 5-foot square, the block deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. A deadfall over a 10-foot square deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 7d6), a deadfall over a 15-foot square deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 5d6), and so on, to a maximum size of a 25-foot square. Only creatures that are on the outer edge of the area affected by a <i>conjure deadfall</i> spell can attempt Reflex saves to avoid the effect; creatures whose space does not touch the edge of the deadfall do not receive a save.
</p>

<p>
In order to deal damage, the conjured deadfall must start at least 10 feet above the tallest creature in the area to be affected. A conjured deadfall is as tall as it is wide, and the spell fails if you attempt to conjure a deadfall in an area already occupied by a creature or object (including the ceiling). Regardless, a deadfall conjured by this spell disappears as soon as it deals damage or strikes the ground.

This spell blesses an area with positive energy. The DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers minor disruption, suffering a &minus;1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus to positive channeled energy DCs, &minus;2 penalties for undead in the area).

You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron. Instead, the <i>consecrate</i> spell curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power.

<p>
You send out a magical message to any eldritch entities of a particular kind within a 100-mile radius, which can be delivered to up to 20 such creatures, starting with the nearest creatures until the limit has been met. This spell can&rsquo;t contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can&rsquo;t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar <i>contact entity</i> spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don&rsquo;t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn&rsquo;t call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.
</p>

<p>
How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn&rsquo;s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like <i>scrying</i>, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.
</p>

<p>
Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown below. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire. Contacting certain types of creatures makes the spell chaotic, evil, or both, as indicated on the table.

When touched, the target begins experiencing the effects of the same drug by which you are currently affected (select one, if you are under the influence of more than one drug). The target doesn&rsquo;t take any ability damage or risk addiction from the drug.
</p>

<p>
You cannot impart the effects of any potion, poison, elixir, or mutagen currently affecting you.

<p>
When you cast this spell, you fall into a trance and become helpless as long as you continue concentrating. Choose any one Knowledge skill other than arcana or planes. Your mind is placed in telepathic contact with a nalfeshnee demon skilled at that particular Knowledge skill, in addition to arcana and planes. Each round that you continue to concentrate, you may ask the nalfeshnee one question and it will answer as best it can. If you ask a question about arcana or planes, the nalfeshnee has a +23 bonus to the skill check. If you ask about the Knowledge skill you selected, the nalfeshnee has a +20 bonus. It cannot answer questions pertaining to other Knowledge skills&mdash;to do so, you must cast the spell again.
</p>

<p>
Contact with Abyssal minds is dangerous, and each time the nalfeshnee answers a question, you suffer 1d4 points of ability drain to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (determined randomly) unless you make a DC 22 Will save. Each additional question you ask with this spell over the course of a single 24-hour period imparts a cumulative &minus;1 penalty on this saving throw. Chaotic evil spellcasters always gain a +4 bonus on this saving throw.

<p>
You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;no,&rdquo; &ldquo;maybe,&rdquo; &ldquo;never,&rdquo; &ldquo;irrelevant,&rdquo; or some other one-word answer.
</p>

<p>
You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels.
</p>

<p>
Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.

<p>
You blast several enemies with beams of fire. You may fire three rays, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of five rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.
</p>

<p>
The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
Every round on your turn, a new ray of fire launches from each creature who took damage from the spell in the previous round&mdash;these new rays attack as if you fired them, but their point of origin is the previous creature damaged. You can choose the new targets as a free action, all of whom must be within close range (25&rsquo; + 5&rsquo;/2 levels) of their new starting point. This contagion of flame continues for a total of three rounds&mdash;a creature can be struck more than once by this spell over the course of these three rounds, although never by a ray of fire that launches from itself.

This spell functions as per <i><a href="#Suggestion">suggestion</a></i>, except the target can pass on the enchantment to other targets. The target is compelled to communicate your <i>suggestion</i> to another creature, forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the <i>suggestion</i> effect on the initial target isn&rsquo;t negated. If a secondary target fails, it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread the <i>suggestion</i>.

The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, 1d6 temporary hit points, and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects and to the DC of Intimidate checks attempted against her. Once per round, the target can select one other creature to gain this bonus as well. The chosen creature can be no farther from the target than 25 feet + 5 feet for every 2 caster levels you possess, and a creature can&rsquo;t be selected more than once in this way. Such allies gain only the bonuses and temporary hit points; they don&rsquo;t continue to spread it to other creatures. The additional creatures&rsquo; bonuses and temporary hit points share the original spell&rsquo;s duration, so when that duration ends, all affected creatures lose their bonuses and any remaining temporary hit points from this spell.

<p>
The randomness of critical hits has long vexed certain duelists in the Aldori school who consider luck to be an unwelcome addition to duels, which they view as contests of skill rather than chance. The creature targeted by this spell is infused with magical power, altering the odds of combat to weaken lucky strikes. Critical threats made by the affected creature automatically fail to confirm. Critical threats that automatically confirm due to class features or feats, such as the fighter&rsquo;s weapon mastery, are unaffected by this spell. In addition, when the initial target of this spell fails its Will save to resist <i>contest of skill</i>, it can select one additional creature within range of the spell to suffer the effects of the spell as well (Will negates). If this secondary target negates this spell with a successful save, the duration of <i>contest of skill</i> on the primary target is reduced to 1 round.

You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting <i>contingency</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>contingency</i> spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast <i>contingency</i>.
</p>

<p>
The spell to be brought into effect by the <i>contingency</i> must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).
</p>

<p>
The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the <i>contingency</i> immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being &ldquo;cast&rdquo; instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur.
</p>

<p>
If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<i>contingency</i> and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.
</p>

You can use only one <i>contingency</i> spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

<p>
The target gains an extra action that becomes available when a condition that you dictate is met. At the time of casting, you dictate the condition, and the target specifies a readied action that occurs when triggered by this condition.
</p>

<p>
The condition needed to trigger the readied action must be clear, although it can be general. If a complicated or convoluted condition is prescribed, the whole combination might fail when triggered. For example, suppose the trigger and the action are stated as &ldquo;If the target is attacked while he is not holding a weapon, he draws a weapon.&rdquo; If the target has no weapon to draw when the trigger occurs, the action fails. If the trigger and the action are &ldquo;If an ally within 20 feet falls unconscious, the target moves to a space adjacent to that ally&rdquo; but the target is chained to a wall when the trigger occurs and can&rsquo;t reach the unconscious ally, the action fails.
</p>

<p>
The readied action must be a standard, a move, or a swift action, and it cannot be used to cast a spell or use a supernatural ability. This action counts as a readied action and doesn&rsquo;t count toward the number of actions the creature can take in a round. When the condition occurs, the target can decide not to use the readied action. Once the condition is triggered, the spell is discharged&mdash;whether or not the target uses the readied action or the action is successful.

<p>
You transfer the power of a scroll to the target so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate. Casting this spell destroys the scroll, but allows the spell in it to be triggered in a manner similar to the <i>contingency</i> spell. The spell on the scroll must be a spell on your spell list, it must affect the target of this spell (the target of this spell is considered the caster of the scroll), and its level must be no higher than one-fourth your caster level (maximum 5th level).
</p>

<p>
The writing on the scroll appears on the target&rsquo;s skin in any location you desire; this writing does not harm or interfere with the target in any way, and doesn&rsquo;t need to be on exposed skin to function. For example, you could make the writing appear under a target&rsquo;s clothing. The writing on the target&rsquo;s skin can be deciphered and identified as if it were the scroll it was copied from. Damaging the target has no effect on the stored spell, but effects such as <i>erase</i> that target magical writing can affect it.
</p>

<p>
The condition needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although it can be general. In all cases, this spell immediately brings into effect the scroll&rsquo;s spell, the latter being effectively cast instantaneously when the trigger occurs.

You seize control of a summoned creature by disrupting the bond between it and the caster who summoned it. If the creature fails its save, you may command it as if you had summoned it. The original caster can attempt to regain control of the creature as a standard action by making an opposed Spellcraft check against you. When your spell ends, control reverts to the original summoner. If the summoning spell ends before this spell ends, the remaining duration of this spell is lost.

This spell has two different applications, both of which control water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water&rsquo;s depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Lower Water:
	<td>	This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level &times; 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a <i><a href="#Slow">slow</a></i> spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.
<tr>
	<th>	Raise Water:
	<td>	This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.
</table>

With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change the overall area of effect.

When you cast this spell, you draw the remains of nearby destroyed undead together and fuse them into a mass of flesh and bone you can then hurl at any foes within range.
</p>

<p>
Three corpses within range of the spell are required for the spell to function. The hammer can be directed to attack one foe within range per round as a move action. It uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, modified by your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever one is highest). On a hit, the <i>corpse hammer</i> deals 1d6 points of damage per three caster levels (to a maximum of 6d6 points of damage).
</p>

<p>
Corpse hammer also has secondary effects based on the nature of the three bodies you use to create it. If the majority used to create it (at least two) were skeletal, the jagged bits of bone cause the hammer to deal slashing damage and increase its critical threat range to 19&ndash;20. On the other hand, if the majority were fleshy (at least two), the increased mass causes the spell to deal bludgeoning damage and increase its critical hit damage to &times;3.
</p>

<p>
Undead that have been destroyed by positive energy or a similar effect that does not leave a corpse, like a <i>disintegrate</i> spell, cannot be used to form a <i>corpse hammer</i>.

These <i>corpse lanterns</i> shed dim light in a 20-foot radius, and do not increase the light level in areas of normal light or bright light. In dim or normal light, the radiance of <i>corpse lanterns</i> provides a strange contrast, giving all creatures in the area a &minus;5 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, the hue interferes with illusion (pattern) spells, giving all creatures in the illuminated area a +2 bonus on any saving throws against such spells.

Anytime a harmless (so noted by a spell&rsquo;s saving throw description) spell of 3rd level or lower is cast within a <i>covetous aura&rsquo;s</i> area of effect, you may choose to immediately gain the benefit of that spell as if it had also targeted you. The intended target still gains the effect of the spell. You gain the benefits of this duplicated spell only if the caster is in range of the <i>covetous aura</i>. You are considered the caster of the additional spell effect. If the effect allows for multiple targets other than yourself, you cannot use the stolen spell effect to target other creatures&mdash;a <i>covetous aura</i> only aids you. Once you choose to gain the benefit of another spell, the <i>covetous aura</i> immediately ends. Rumors hold that this unusual spell was invented thousands of years ago by Runelord Belimarius, who was constantly jealous of other spellcasters&rsquo; abilities.

You curse the target with insatiable greed, causing it to attempt to steal any item worth 100 gp or more that it can see, each time it enters a new room or area. If it can see multiple items of value in a single room or area, it attempts to steal the item it thinks is worth the most. This covetous compulsion might cause the target to act recklessly where it normally would not (unless acting in this manner would clearly cause it to die, suffer great harm, or get caught).
</p>

<p>
In combat, if the target sees a valuable item on an opponent, it must, for example, attempt to disarm its foe to take a valuable weapon or use the steal combat maneuver to grab a precious item kept on the opponent&rsquo;s belt. Once the target has either attempted to steal an item in combat or else taken damage, this magical compulsion subsides until the threat of the current combat ends and the target enters a new room or area. Affected targets in combat that have neither attempted to steal an item nor taken damage (perhaps because the opponent with the most valuable item is far away) can attempt a saving throw each round to ignore the spell&rsquo;s effect until the threat ends and the target enters a new room.

You imbue the target with a compulsion to avoid threats, enhancing its defensive instincts. So long as the affected creature does not move closer to enemies during its turn, or moves at least 5 feet away from adjacent enemies, it gains a +1 morale bonus to its AC, and a +1 morale bonus on saves and on attack rolls made as readied actions and attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, if the affected creature does not close with its enemies, it can increase the DC of all spells it casts as part of a readied action by 1. If the subject of the spell willingly moves toward a threatening creature, the spell immediately ends.

You compel an opponent to face you in combat, or suffer for its cowardice. Each round that the target fails to attack you in melee, it receives a cumulative &minus;1 penalty to its Armor Class, attack rolls, and saving throws (maximum penalty &minus;5). Each round at the end of its turn, the target may attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the penalties from increasing for that round. All penalties reset to zero when the target attacks you in melee, but increase again if it stops attacking. If the target is prevented from attacking you by physical restraint, magic, or impassable terrain, the penalties do not increase. If you move away from the target, the spell ends.

You concentrate feelings of competitiveness, envy, and ill will into a poltergeist-like haunt that wreaks havoc on its victim&rsquo;s long-term endeavors. Every time a creature in the affected area attempts a Craft or Profession check to generate income, create an item, or earn capital, any skill check required for crafting or repairing a magic item, or any skill check required for an occult ritual, the haunt imposes a &minus;5 penalty on the check. If the creature fails its check by 5 or more, the haunt&rsquo;s mischief deals 1d6 points of damage to the creature in addition to any other negative effects from such a failure. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or longer, the haunt becomes similarly disruptive, requiring the caster to succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) or lose the spell and take 1d6 points of damage from the mischief. Each time the haunt is disruptive, the spell&rsquo;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.

<table class=Options>

<tr>
	<th>	Bountiful:
	<td>	Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.
<tr>
	<th>	Elemental:
	<td>	Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water-elemental dominant trait.
<tr>
	<th>	Gravity:
	<td>	By default a demiplane&rsquo;s gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane&rsquo;s gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional.
<tr>
	<th>	Seasonal:
	<td>	The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on).
<tr>
	<th>	Shape:
	<td>	By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge. You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.
<tr>
	<th>	Structure:
	<td>	Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).

If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as &ldquo;effects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire&rdquo; or &ldquo;death spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.&rdquo; A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.

<tr>
	<th>	Portal:
	<td>	Your demiplane gains a permanent <i>gate</i> to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you.

<p>
You create a small, finite demiplane. You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell.
</p>

<p>
When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The &ldquo;walls&rdquo; and &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane&rsquo;s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane&rsquo;s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.
</p>

<p>
There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane&rsquo;s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on.
</p>

<p>
For example, you could use <i>move earth</i> to create a hill or <i>wall of stone</i> to create a barricade.
</p>

<p>
When you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as <i>astral projection</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, or <i>plane shift</i>. You are considered &ldquo;very familiar&rdquo; with your entire demiplane.
</p>

<p>
As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using <i>limited wish</i>, <i>mage&rsquo;s disjunction</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> and making a successful dispel check.
</p>

<p>
If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by the spell again to create a linked area between the two.
</p>

<p>
You can make this spell permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast <i>create lesser demiplane</i> multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting&rsquo;s area requires its own <i>permanency</i> spell.

The caster conjures into being one of the following drugs: aether, flayleaf, opium, pesh, scour, shiver, or zerk. (At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, other drugs of similar power can be included on this list.) The drug doses the caster creates with this spell must be used within 1 minute of being conjured, or they dissolve into worthless dust or evaporate into noxious but fleeting vapors, though the effects of the drug may last far longer if taken before it decays.
</p>

<p>
The drugs created by this spell cannot be sold, but they can be given to other creatures. A creature that takes a dose of one of these drug typically must be either willing or helpless, though some drugs might be inhaled, applied to injuries, or secretly slipped into food if the caster acts swiftly (see each drug&rsquo;s description). The DC to resist a drug created by this spell is based on the conjurer&rsquo;s caster level, not the DC listed in the common versions of the drug.
</p>

<p>
As a special use of this spell, a lawful evil worshiper of Mahathallah, the Dowager of Illusions, can create doses of the drug adyton (see the sidebar above). A Mahathallah worshiper can create adyton only once per week, regardless of her level or how many times she casts this spell. The spell otherwise functions&mdash;and creates as many doses&mdash;as normal.

You create a path of handholds on earthen, plaster, stone, or wooden walls (not on walls made of metal or other, harder materials). The handholds are created in pairs and are approximately 3 feet apart, located in a specific path indicated by your gestures while casting the spell. The handholds&rsquo; path can span up to 30 feet out from you plus an additional 10 feet per 3 caster levels (maximum 90 feet at 18th level). The handholds protrude approximately 6 inches from the wall, measure 10 inches lengthwise, and are perfectly suited for gripping with fingers or claws. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, any creature being supported by the handholds immediately begins to fall.

<p>
You create an immersive mindscape that the minds of both you and another creature enter together. You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it&rsquo;s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can&rsquo;t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.
</p>

<p>
You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don&rsquo;t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can&rsquo;t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it&rsquo;s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;re in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.
</p>

<p>
More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the <i>mindscape door</i> spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape but you&rsquo;re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.
</p>

<p>
As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it&rsquo;s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn&rsquo;t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.
</p>

<p>
This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.
</p>

<p>
<i>Create mindscape</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp. You and other creatures aware of a permanent mindscape can come and go using the <i>mindscape door</i> spell.

You create a 10-foot-by-10-foot extradimensional hole with a depth of 10 feet per two caster levels (maximum 30 feet).
You must create the pit on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.
Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling into it.
In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it.
Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect.
</p>

<p>
Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal.
The pit&rsquo;s coarse stone walls have a Climb DC of 25. When the duration of the spell ends, creatures within the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the surface over the course of a single round.

<p>
You draw forth the ebbing life force of a dying creature or one that has died in the past round, focusing it through a crystal lens focus to transform into a soul gem. If the creature is alive and fails its saving throw, it dies and you capture its soul in the gem. If the creature is dead, it can still resist the spell effect by attempting a Will save as if it were still alive. The value of the soul gem created depends on the nature of the creature it is made from. Soul gems created by this spell crumble to dust once the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, releasing the trapped soul to travel on to judgment in the Great Beyond.
</p>

<p>
Only one soul gem can be created from a dying creature. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a soul gem requires a caster check against <i>create soul</i> gem&rsquo;s save DC. Failure results in the resurrection spell having no effect, while success shatters the target&rsquo;s soul gem and returns the creature to life as normal. If the soul gem resides in an unholy location, such as that created by the <i>unhallow</i> spell, the DC of this check increases by 2.
</p>

<p>
If you are a souldrinker, you can cast this spell and expend 5 soul points to fill the gem with the equivalent of one basic soul.

You can take a piece from a dead creature&rsquo;s body and use it to create a map that reveals the locations of any valuables that creature knew about while still alive. You must cut this piece off yourself and the creature cannot have died more than 24 hours prior to the casting of this spell. You cannot cast this spell on a creature without a physical body, and the portion you remove must have a fairly level surface such as a piece of hide, carapace, or skin. The map you create is accurate to the best knowledge the creature had at the time of its death. It reveals the location of one source of treasure for every three caster levels you possess.
</p>

<p>
Any inaccuracies or faulty information held by the creature are represented on the map as well. Similarly, the map cannot account for any changes that occur after the creature&rsquo;s death.
</p>

<p>
You must choose the scale of the map when creating it, opting between nearby (e.g., one or two dungeon levels), local (e.g., a valley or community), or broad (e.g., a country or larger). The map reveals the locations of what the creature deemed most valuable within its area. Depending on the creature, the map might reveal a source of tasty food, suitable mates, or even your own treasure vault.

This spell summons four massive swarms of biting and stinging insects. These swarms appear adjacent to one another, but can be directed to move independently. Treat these swarms as centipede swarms with the following adjustments. The swarms have 60 hit points each and deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm attack. The save to resist their poison and distraction effects is equal to the save DC of this spell. Creatures caught in multiple swarms only take damage and make saves once.
</p>

<p>
You may summon the swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. As a standard action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any target within 100 feet of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet).

This spell covers the floor, the ground, or some other calm horizontal surface (such as a placid lake or a gentle river) with a sheet of slowly growing ice. The initial sheet of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ice is hard, strong, and opaque, and is 1 inch thick per caster level. The ice is strong enough to support the weight of a typical horse, making it possible for creatures to cross a body of water.
</p>

<p>
Each 10-foot square of ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the ice automatically. A section of ice whose hit points drop to 0 is destroyed, leaving an area of ice chunks, slush, and snow that counts as difficult terrain. If a creature tries to break through the ice with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + your caster level.
</p>

<p>
Each round on your turn, the sheet of ice grows 1 foot in all directions except toward you. This growth is slow enough that any creature in the area has time to move out of the way or step onto the ice. If the growing ice completely covers a creature&rsquo;s square, the creature must choose whether it moves onto the sheet of ice, is knocked prone on the sheet of ice, or is bull rushed into an adjacent square.

You can make up to three <i>suggestions</i> to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the <i><a href="#Mass Suggestion">mass suggestion</a></i> spell (Will save negates). Only creatures within range at the time of a <i>suggestion</i> are subject to it.

You gain the ability to detect fear, as per <i><a href="#Sense Fear">sense fear</a></i>, but you sense creatures within medium range.
</p>

<p>
Once per round as a standard action, you can teleport to a creature suffering from a fear effect within the spell&rsquo;s range if you are aware of the creature and its rough location. You can carry objects with you so long as you don&rsquo;t transport more than your maximum load. You arrive in a random open space within 20 feet of the creature and immediately begin sensing the location of creatures with a fear condition from your new location.
</p>

<p>
Once you teleport to a new location with this spell, you can take no additional actions for the round, as if casting <i><a href="#Dimension Door">dimension door</a></i>. You can&rsquo;t teleport if there are no creatures suffering from a fear effect in range.

This spell was created by the paladins of the Mendevian Crusades, and co-opted by inquisitors and rangers dedicated to tracking and fighting demons, devils, and other evil extraplanar creatures.

<p>
When you cast this spell on a melee weapon you imbue it with a powerful holy energy, granting the weapon the <i>bane</i> weapon quality against evil outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you not only deal normal critical damage with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3 rounds&mdash;the outsider can reduce this nauseated condition to sickened for 1 round with a successful Fortitude save.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Interposing Hand">interposing hand</a></i>, except that it can also grapple one opponent as <i><a href="#Grasping Hand">grasping hand</a></i>. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A <i>crushing hand</i> deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The <i>crushing hand</i> can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as <i><a href="#Forceful Hand">forceful hand</a></i>), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as <i>interposing hand</i> does.

<p>
When casting this spell, you must concentrate on a culture or subculture to which you wish to adapt. If you speak the native language of the culture in question, then for the duration of this spell, you speak the language with a native accent. The spell doesn&rsquo;t teach you the language in question, but can be combined with <i>tongues</i> or a similar spell. Your body language and gestures mark you as a native of the culture, and you unconsciously make small decisions that help you blend in. Combined, these grant you a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence members of the culture to which you have adapted, which doesn&rsquo;t stack with other circumstance bonuses you might possess by virtue of being a member of the chosen culture. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to pass yourself off as if you were a member of the culture, if you are not.
</p>

<p>
This doesn&rsquo;t provide benefits when disguising yourself as a specific member of the culture, though it negates any circumstance penalties you might otherwise have taken due to not acting appropriately for that person&rsquo;s culture. Finally, the DCs of enchantment (charm) spells you cast against natives of the culture to which you are attuned increase by 1.

You curse the target, making it incredibly unlucky.

The target also can&rsquo;t choose a die result, such as taking 10 or 20 in lieu of rolling (as per the bard&rsquo;s lore master ability). Finally, the first time each turn the target would succeed at an attack, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and use the worse of the two results.

You place a curse upon a creature, causing it to avoid the sight of a specific trigger, which is a kind of creature, object, or condition designated by you. When the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and is aware of the trigger, it gains the sickened condition and feels an urge to leave. A successful Will save negates the urge to leave, but the sickened condition persists as long as the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and aware of it. Example triggers include beggars, filthy clothing, diseased creatures, the king, blood, spiders, rats, corpses, and sewage.

You invest a target with cursed elemental energy, making the open skies anathema to it. If the affected creature ever tries to fly more than 5 feet above the ground, paper insects erupt from the air around the creature to interfere with its movement. The affected creature&rsquo;s flight maneuverability decreases by one step for every 3 caster levels you have. A creature whose maneuverability would be brought below clumsy must land at the end of its turn each round or fall.

You curse one living creature with a chance of instant and unexpected death. When you cast this spell, your hand seethes with eerie gray fire. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to touch the target, at which time the fire buries itself within the target&rsquo;s body and disappears. On the round you touch the creature and once per minute thereafter, roll 1d100. On a result of 01&ndash;05, the spell is triggered and the creature takes 8d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level; the creature can attempt a saving throw to reduce the damage to 2d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. On a result of 06&ndash;100, nothing happens.
</p>

<p>
Once the spell is triggered or if the duration expires before it triggers, the magic ends and no further 1d100 rolls are made. If the target has spell resistance, a caster level check is made when you succeed at the touch attack. A creature can be affected by only one instance of this spell at a time. The untriggered spell can be removed with <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or similar effects.

Grapple checks for attacks other than constricting (such as pinning or swallowing whole) are not affected.

If the affected creature isn&rsquo;t a humanoid, there is a 75% chance that the creature returns to life as a youth of its race, gaining the young creature simple template instead (or becomes a juvenile, in the case of dragons and other creatures whose power is determined by their age category).

You can use <i>cyclic reincarnation</i> on someone who was killed by a death effect or turned into an undead creature and then destroyed, but nonhumanoids so restored always return to life with the young creature simple template (or as a juvenile, in the case of creatures whose power is determined by their age category).

Beginning on its next turn, the target attacks the subject determined by the chart with a melee weapon, natural weapon, or supernatural ability that deals damage. If necessary, it moves to or charges to the subject in order to make this attack. If it is unable to reach its subject on its next turn, the target uses its turn to get as close as possible to the subject of its bloodlust. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls, and cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any abilities that require patience or concentration. This spell is otherwise treated as <i>confusion</i> and <i>rage</i>&mdash;any creature immune to <i>confusion</i> or <i>rage</i> is immune to this spell, and any ability or effect that ends <i>confusion</i> or <i>rage</i> (such as <i>calm emotions</i>) can end this spell.

You pass judgment on your enemies&rsquo; intentions and punish them with holy power. Each creature in the spell&rsquo;s area takes 1d8 points of damage per spell level, determined by the most powerful effect with the evil descriptor either affecting that creature or in its spell repertoire. A caster who prepares spells takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell he prepared that day, even if he already cast that spell. A spontaneous spellcaster takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell she knows, even if she has no remaining spell slots available to cast that spell. A creature with evil spell-like abilities takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell-like ability it can use. A creature who doesn&rsquo;t cast spells but is the willing beneficiary of evil spells takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell currently affecting it, including spells that affect an area such as <i>desecrate</i>. A creature subject to the harmful effects of an evil spell are unaffected unless it voluntarily accepted the spell&rsquo;s effects.

You name one creature and excise all memory of that creature&rsquo;s involvement in events the targets remember. The targets either forget who exactly performed the named creature&rsquo;s deeds or assume some other individual performed them. Alternatively, you can name either one event lasting no more than 10 minutes per caster level or a single topic (defined at the GM&rsquo;s discretion) such as a shameful secret of the king that was recently revealed or a small revolt that was quelled messily, and erase all recollection of that subject from the minds of all creatures within the area. Memory of facts and topics that are common knowledge (information with a Knowledge check DC of 10 or less) cannot be stolen via this spell.
</p>

<p>
The lost memories are stored in the focus gem (which grows dull inside and cannot be used as a focus or material component for any other spell, including another casting of this spell). The targets emanate no magic and the spell cannot be dispelled from them; only the focus retains a magic aura, and only by targeting the gem can the spell be dispelled, disjoined, or suppressed with antimagic. If the gem is destroyed or the spell is dispelled (which destroys the gem), all stolen memories return to the affected creatures.

This spell causes ammunition already loaded into the target firearm is ruined with moisture. Any attempt to fire that ammunition fails, with no chance for misfire, and the user must then take a full-round action to clear the weapon before reloading and firing it. If aware of this spell&rsquo;s effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm&rsquo;s user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm.

Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o&rsquo;-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The <i>dancing lights</i> must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like.

You communicate through the shadows of one or more targets within range. The shadows have no physical presence and don&rsquo;t move or animate. Instead, your words emerge from the shadow as a clear whisper, absent any accent or other identifying features. The targets can make conversation with the shadow, but must speak aloud to do so. The targets&rsquo; voices emerge from your own shadow only when they intend to speak to the shadow, but you hear no other sounds from the target&rsquo;s immediate area. Their responses also emerge as clear whispers, absent identifying features, but you can instinctively identify which target is speaking to you through the shadow. Once the spell has been cast, you don&rsquo;t need to have line of effect to the targets or their shadows to communicate back and forth.
</p>

<p>
The shadow communication is audible, so it can be intercepted by adversaries who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check. The spell can be silenced. You can&rsquo;t cast spells on subjects or otherwise establish line of effect through the shadows, but spells that allow you to speak or understand languages work normally across <i>dark whispers</i>.

This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20-foot radius. This darkness causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in darkness.
</p>

<p>
Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of <i>darkness</i>. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than <i>darkness</i>.
</p>

<p>
If <i>darkness</i> is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell&rsquo;s effect is blocked until the covering is removed.
</p>

<p>
This spell does not stack with itself. <i>Darkness</i> can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.

You ward an area&rsquo;s shadows such that light cannot penetrate them. The illumination level in the affected area no longer changes when nonmagical light enters it.

You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light.

You reshape the substance of a willing undead creature to resemble a living, breathing creature of the same size. This is a physical change to the undead creature&rsquo;s bone, flesh, or incorporeal ectoplasm, adding new flesh or bone and even hair, teeth, and blood, all of which demonstrate false signs of life that mimic a living creature&rsquo;s breathing and other physiological processes. An incorporeal undead creature using <i>daywalker</i> ceases to be incorporeal for the duration of the spell, gaining a physical corpse body. Creatures interacting with the undead can attempt a Perception check (DC = 30 or DC = 21 + the undead&rsquo;s Disguise modifier, whichever is higher) to realize that the signs of life are false, and a close examination with a Heal check always reveals the truth of the dead flesh.
</p>

If the undead has the frightful presence, incorporeal, light blindness, light sensitivity, stench, sunlight powerlessness, or unnatural aura abilities, the spell suppresses them. An undead creature whose touch normally deals damage, ability drain, or energy drain doesn&rsquo;t do so while under the spell&rsquo;s effects.

<i>Dazzling blade</i> makes a weapon appear dazzlingly shiny, as if crafted from pure silver and heavily polished. In combat, the flashing movements of a <i>dazzling blade</i> become almost hypnotic. The wielder of a weapon under the effects of <i>dazzling blade</i> gains a +1 competence bonus on all Bluff checks made to feint in combat. The wielder also gains a +1 competence bonus on all CMB checks made to disarm a foe, and a +1 competence bonus to his CMD against disarm attempts made against the weapon bearing the <i>dazzling blade</i> effect. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 caster levels, to a maximum bonus of +5 at 12th level.
</p>

<p>
The wielder of a <i>dazzling blade</i> can discharge the spell into a blinding burst of silvery light as a free action. The wielder selects an adjacent opponent as the focal point of this burst of light&mdash;that creature must make a Will save to avoid being blinded for 1 round (with a successful save, the creature is instead dazzled for 1 round).
</p>

<p>
Despite its shiny appearance, a <i>dazzling blade</i> grants no extra benefit against creatures that are vulnerable to silver.

Chanting an unholy litany, you reach out with a grasping motion toward your target and cause its heart to leap out of its chest and into your hand. A target with 200 or fewer hit points remaining that fails its saving throw is instantly reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to your caster level or its Constitution score &minus; 1, whichever is less negative. The creature is staggered until the beginning of your next turn, at which point it dies. If the affected creature receives a <i>regenerate</i> spell before the beginning of your next turn, the creature gains the normal benefits of that spell and, thanks to its heart&rsquo;s regeneration, it doesn&rsquo;t immediately die when your next turn begins. If a creature that dies from <i>death clutch</i> is brought back from the dead by a <i>breath of life</i> or <i>raise dead</i> spell, it must also be targeted with <i>regenerate</i> on the following round to restore its missing heart or be unable to return to life.
</p>

<p>
A target with 201 or more hit points that fails its saving throw manages to keep its heart from leaping out of its chest, but it is still staggered for 1 minute and takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Constitution bleed.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of its current hit points, if the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it is still staggered until the beginning of your next turn as it feels its heart wrenching within its chest.

This spell allows you to turn a potion into a temporary pool of necromantic energy. Only a potion created using a conjuration (healing) spell can be affected by this spell. An affected potion turns dark red and reveals a necromantic aura if <i>detect magic</i> is cast on it while it remains under this spell&rsquo;s effects.
</p>

<p>
When you drink a potion affected by this spell, you do not gain the potion&rsquo;s normal effect. Instead, the first necromancy spell you cast within the next minute is cast at a higher caster level. The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell used to create the potion that <i>deathwine</i> affects. For example, a 5th-level wizard who drinks <i>deathwine</i> made from a <i>potion of cure serious wounds</i> would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster, as <i>cure serious wounds</i> is a 3rd-level spell.

The target is surrounded by a glowing green aura of ill fate. Each time the spell&rsquo;s subject makes an attack or casts a spell, it must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC = 10 + &frac12; caster level + Charisma (in the case of oracles), Intelligence (in the case of witches), or Wisdom (in the case of clerics). If it fails the saving throw, it deals half damage with the attack or spell. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when the target confirms a critical hit; doing so negates the critical hit. The attack that you negated still hits, but only deals half damage.

You can cast this spell only as a response to a confirmed critical hit against the target that would deal slashing damage. If the target fails the saving throw and has a discernible head, the attack deals an extra 4d6 points of damage and the critical multiplier of the critical hit increases by 1. If the critical hit then brings the target to 0 hit points or fewer, the target is instantly decapitated and dies unless it can survive decapitation. Even on a successful saving throw, the critical hit deals an extra 4d6 points of damage.

<p>
You subtly alter both the target&rsquo;s aura and subtle cues in its body language, tone of voice, and word choice, which makes everything that the target says seem to be a lie. Every statement that the target makes appears to be a lie under both magical scrutiny (such as <i>discern lies</i>) and mundane scrutiny (such as using the Sense Motive skill). Someone who closely scrutinizes the target can determine when it is actually telling the truth with a successful Sense Motive check (DC = 15 + your caster level).
</p>

<p>
As long as you are within close range of the target, as a standard action you can suppress or resume the effects of this spell, allowing you to let the target seem to be telling the truth at some times and still seem to be lying at others.

<p>
You create a contingent ward that defies those who would dispel your magic, convincing them that their spell worked. When a spell such as <i>dispel magic</i> would end one of your spells that&rsquo;s affecting you, you can dismiss <i>deceptive redundancy</i> as an immediate action to attempt an opposed caster level check against the spellcaster. If you succeed, the dispelling effect fails to end your spell, and your spell&rsquo;s aura becomes difficult to detect for 1 round per caster level. Any divination attempted during this time fails to perceive the spell&rsquo;s aura unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 15 + your caster level). <i>Deceptive redundancy</i> is most effective when hiding auras for spells that don&rsquo;t have easily perceived effects, rather than visually obvious spells such as <i>enlarge person</i> or <i>fire shield</i>.

A thin red line circles the target&rsquo;s neck. The target&rsquo;s head becomes detachable so long as she removes it willingly. While the target&rsquo;s head is detached, she gains DR 2/&mdash; and immunity to decapitation effects and other effects that require their target to have a head or a particular facial feature. The target is blind so long as she has no head, but she gains blindsense to a distance of 15 feet. The target hears normally even without its head.
</p>

<p>
While detached, the target&rsquo;s head appears to be dead. The target can&rsquo;t see through its eyes or hear events around the head. The target&rsquo;s body knows the direction and distance to its head. Without additional protection, the severed head has AC 7, hardness 5, and 10 hit points. Destroying the head while the spell is in effect kills the target of the spell. If the spell&rsquo;s duration expires normally without the head being reattached, the target dies. If either the target or the head are removed to a different plane, or if the spell is dispelled, the head teleports back to its owner and reattaches without further harm.

This applies to any melee or ranged attack directed against you so long as it uses an attack roll to determine whether or not it strikes you. If an attack misses you, the attacker must make a second attack roll against its own Armor Class, using all of the applicable modifiers of the original attack and if it hits, the attacker takes the attack&rsquo;s damage and suffers all the other consequences of getting struck with that attack. You cannot deflect attacks that miss you for any reason besides a failed attack roll (such as concealment).

You animate the target of the spell, manipulating the glove with your own hand from a distance. The glove moves as you direct it with a fly speed of 30 feet and average maneuverability. Directing the glove is a standard action, though the glove can move up to its speed and perform a task in the same action. You can attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks using the glove, though attempting these checks at a distance increases the normal skill check DCs by 5, or by 20 if you do not have line of sight to the object you are manipulating. The glove can also lift or drag objects using your caster level as your Strength score. The glove cannot wield weapons or make attacks effectively while this spell is in effect.

Originally designed by an Aldori magus who had long admired swashbucklers for their ability to deflect blows, Deivon&rsquo;s parry has swiftly gained popularity among bards and magi alike. Your reflexes snap into action, allowing you to deflect a blow. This spell can be cast only when an opponent makes a melee attack against you, and only before the attack roll has been made. Make a parry attempt with a light or one-handed weapon you&rsquo;re wielding, as if using the swashbuckler&rsquo;s opportune parry and riposte deed (except that this does not require panache). You cannot riposte as part of this spell&rsquo;s effect.

<p>
You reach into the target&rsquo;s mind and put its thought processes into a temporary loop. Whatever full-round, standard, or move actions the creature takes on its first turn after you cast this spell, it must repeat on the turn after that. The creature must take the same type of actions in the same order (for example, making a full attack, casting a specific spell, withdrawing, attempting a bull rush combat maneuver, or activating a magic item) and must act against the same target or targets, but doesn&rsquo;t have to make exactly the same choices (such as using Power Attack when attacking, moving exactly 15 feet, or choosing &ldquo;drop&rdquo; for the <i>command</i> spell). If the circumstances would prevent the target from repeating an action, such as if the target of its attack is dead or the target cannot cast the same spell again, the target instead becomes confused until the spell ends. A creature currently affected by <i>deja vu</i> can&rsquo;t be targeted with another <i>deja vu</i> spell. A creature affected by <i>deja vu</i> can&rsquo;t delay, and if it readies an action on its first turn, it must ready the same action on its second turn.

Choose a creature within range as the object of hunger. All other creatures within 15 feet of the target that can see or smell the target&rsquo;s delectable flesh must succeed at a Will save or spiral into a depraved state from which they gain a single purpose—to consume as much of the target&rsquo;s delicious flesh as possible. The creature chosen as the target of this spell is not affected by this depravity.
</p>

<p>
A depraved creature gains a bite attack, two claw attacks, and the scent ability if it didn&rsquo;t already have them. It drops any items it was carrying and attacks the target of the spell with these natural weapons, acting as if it were confused and the target had attacked it first. This effect lasts for the spell&rsquo;s duration or until the depraved creature can no longer see or smell the object of its hunger for a full minute. Additionally, a depraved creature can attempt a new saving throw to end this effect at the end of any turn in which the affected creature makes an attack against the object of its hunger. If a creature that eats for nourishment succeeds at a save to end the depraved effect early, it takes a &minus;2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, concentration checks, saving throws, and skill checks whenever it is within 15 feet of the target.

A creature that fails its save uses an immediate action to hand you whatever object it&rsquo;s currently wielding or holding.

If it&rsquo;s currently holding or wielding more than one item, determine randomly which item it gives you. If you&rsquo;re no longer adjacent to the creature when it has to give you the item, the spell ends with no effect.

You create a one-handed object that you might expect to see in your current surroundings, which you can then use as an improvised weapon. The spell conjures such an object near your hand such that you can retrieve it as you complete the spell.
</p>

<p>
No matter what sort of object you picked, it functions as a one-handed improvised weapon appropriate for your size and that deals 1d6 points of damage for a Medium creature (1d4 for Small creatures). The item deals the type of damage you choose (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) when casting the spell, though the object you request must conform to the damage type.
</p>

<p>
The spell ends prematurely if the improvised weapon leaves your grasp. The object has no value and can&rsquo;t be used for other functions other than as an improvised weapon (for instance, this spell doesn&rsquo;t allow you to conjure an expensive spyglass and sell it or use its other abilities, but you could still use it to beat someone over the head). The conjured object can&rsquo;t already be a manufactured weapon, even in a location where you might expect to see manufactured weapons. It can be an object that would normally make for an unusual improvised weapon, like a herring at a fish market, and it still deals its full damage.

You attempt to destroy any one robot in range. When you cast this spell, your hand crackles with electricity. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to affect the target.

The target takes 12d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level, or 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level on a successful saving throw. A cyborg or android can be damaged by this spell, but takes half damage and gains a +4 bonus on the saving throw to resist the spell&rsquo;s effects.

This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level. If the spell slays the target, it consumes the remains utterly in holy (or unholy) fire (but not its equipment or possessions). If the target&rsquo;s Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 10d6 points of damage. The only way to restore life to a character who has failed to save against this spell (and was slain) is to use <i>true resurrection</i>, a carefully worded <i>wish</i> spell followed by <i>resurrection</i>, or <i>miracle</i>.

Instead of Intelligence, the second round of concentration reveals each mind&rsquo;s Wisdom score and current degree of fear (shaken, frightened, panicked, cowering, or paralyzed with fear).

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Detect Magic">detect magi</a></i>, except that you can glean much more information from the magical auras that you find, and those auras can be found after a much greater length of time. You can detect a lingering aura for up to 1 day per caster level you have, regardless of the aura&rsquo;s original strength.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, when you use a standard action to concentrate on this spell, you can also study a creature within the spell&rsquo;s area and attempt a Spellcraft check in order to determine the last spell that the creature cast by identifying lingering traces that the spell left in the caster&rsquo;s aura. The DC to identify the spell is equal to 20 + the creature&rsquo;s caster level.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it. In order to find these identifiers in a spell&rsquo;s aura, you must spend 1 round focusing on that spell in particular, and succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcana) check against the caster (or a Knowledge &#91;arcana&#93; check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level if the caster wants her work to be identified and emphasizes these unique elements rather than obscuring them). Once you learn a caster&rsquo;s set of identifiers, you can remember them as easily as a face or a voice. You can recognize this signature if you succeed at a Spellcraft check when later identifying a spell to determine whether or not that spell was cast by the same individual. The spell <i>greater magic aura</i> can obfuscate this information, making it seem that someone else cast the spell. <i>Greater detect magic</i> grants a saving throw against <i>magic aura</i> (but not <i>greater magic aura</i>).

This spell functions similarly to <i><a href="#Detect Thoughts">detect thoughts</a></i>, allowing you to sense when one or more creatures&rsquo; consciousnesses are inside a mindscape. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular subject.

	<th>	2nd Round:
	<td>	You sense the number of consciousnesses inside the mindscape. Not all of the creatures within the mindscape must be standing inside the cone-shaped area of the spell for you to count them; only one is required to get this reading. However, you can&rsquo;t determine the location of the creatures if you can&rsquo;t see the creatures themselves. You sense their presence only in an abstract way.
<tr>
	<th>	3rd Round:
	<td>	You sense an image of what&rsquo;s taking place inside the mindscape. The creature controlling the mindscape can sense your efforts, and if it does not wish you to view the mindscape, it can prevent this viewing with a successful Will save. Otherwise, you perceive the visuals remotely, as if watching through a window. If a creature has disguised itself, you see only the creature&rsquo;s mental mask (not its true form).
</table>

<p>
Each round, you can turn to detect mindscapes in a new area. The spell can penetrate many barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

<p>
If you are within a mindscape when you cast this spell, you become aware you&rsquo;re in a mindscape. On the second round, you can still detect how many consciousnesses are inside, but you don&rsquo;t get the image of the mindscape in the third round.

You detect the presence of psychically significant items in your vicinity. Such items are those that might have significant psychic imprints or histories that can be read by the psychometry occult skill unlock, or items under the effects of the <i>charge object</i> or <i>implant false reading</i> spells. Items within range that contain significant psychic energy spark a recognition in your mind&rsquo;s eye, but no other information is imparted. This spell doesn&rsquo;t automatically detect magic items or strongly aligned items, though such items often have storied histories and might have had previous owners who possessed psychic abilities.

You detect radiation in the surrounding area. You see radioactive auras as a glowing green shimmer in the air that emanates from radioactive objects; the brighter and more intense the green, the more powerful the radioactivity. This glow does not provide illumination or allow you to see in darkness, apart from being able to see the glow itself. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it&mdash;although radiation can seep into such barriers, causing them to become radioactive (and thus visible to the spell) in time.

	<td>	Precise relationship between subjects in the area. A target&rsquo;s Will save prevents you from determining its exact relationship with another creature, and only one subject needs to succeed at this save to prevent you from determining its relationship with another creature. (So, for instance, if two brothers are in the area and one succeeds at his Will save, you could tell that they are siblings, but could not distinguish whether they are full- or half-siblings.)

This spell functions by analyzing the blood and minds of creatures in the area, collectively examining these traits and comparing them to those of others in the area while looking for patterns. Thus, adoptive siblings and parents cannot be detected with this spell, since they share no blood.

A creature&rsquo;s personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether or not it is of the same faith as you&mdash;hence heretics and splinter cultists of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. Furthermore, since the spell picks up a creature&rsquo;s current beliefs and feelings, a creature actively pretending to be a member of the same faith also appears to the spell to be a member. Thus, the spell is still useful in locating potential hidden members of the same faith among the general populace, but on its own, it doesn&rsquo;t weed out spies.

With a touch, you can determine the exact thickness of a wall, ceiling, or other solid barrier, measuring from the point you are touching to the direct opposite side of the barrier in a straight line. You can only detect depths or widths of up to 10 feet per caster level (maximum 200 feet at 20th level); amounts in excess of this limit are detected as being the maximum you are able to detect. So, for example, a 5th-level wizard using this spell on a 60-foot-thick wall would detect that the wall is 50 feet thick.

<p>
<i>Determine depth</i> can be used on earthen, plaster, stone, or wooden surfaces, but not on walls made of metal or other, harder materials. This spell is useful to casters who want to get an idea of their surroundings, and as a preliminary measure to casting spells such as <i>passwall</i> or <i>dimension door</i>.

When this spell creates the explosion of energy, choose one of the following four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

You remove a creature&rsquo;s ability to poison others, whether inherent or via poisoned weapons. Whenever an affected creature would inflict poison with an attack, spell, or other method (including auras and other constant methods), that poison is automatically neutralized. This does not grant the subject of the spell any resistance to poison itself.

Your touch creates an invisible circle on a flat surface. Any outsider passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught within. Once trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard action to physically exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any form of extradimensional travel (as per <i><a href="#Dimensional Anchor">dimensional anchor</a></i>). Contained outsiders can still attack adjacent creatures outside of the circle, or target others with ranged attacks, spells, and spell-like abilities. Despite the spell&rsquo;s name, <i>devil snare</i> captures outsiders of any type, not only devils.
</p>

<p>
As a standard action, you can dismiss the circle, expelling any outsiders still trapped within to their planes of origin (as per dismissal). An outsider can resist this effect with a successful Will save, enabling it to remain after the spell is dismissed.

You determine whether a creature, object, or area carries any sort of disease or infestation (including molds, slimes, and similar hazards), or any exceptional or supernatural effects causing the sickened or nauseated effects. If there is disease present, you know what disease it is and its effects. If the target is a creature, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to treat the creature&rsquo;s disease. The spell can penetrate many barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired&mdash;whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can&rsquo;t take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
</p>

<p>
If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location.

If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.

A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a <i>dimensional anchor</i> include <i>astral projection</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>ethereal jaunt</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, <i>gate</i>, <i>maze</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>shadow walk</i>, <i>teleport</i>, and similar spell-like abilities.

This spell gives you the power to turn one melee weapon in your hand into a two-dimensional object with length and height but no width. A sword becomes a flat image of a sword, a mace is reduced to a flat outline, and so on. The magic of the spell allows the weapon to be wielded by you normally, creating just enough depth to grasp it.
</p>

<p>
Attacks made with the weapon are melee touch attacks that ignore all armor. Force effects, such as <i>mage armor</i> and <i>shield</i>, still apply their AC against attacks made with a <i>dimensional blade</i>. Bludgeoning weapons used to make attacks with this spell deal half damage and are treated as slashing weapons. If the weapon leaves your hand before the end of the spell, the effect ends.

A <i>discern location</i> spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a <i>mind blank</i> spell or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. <i>Discern location</i> circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object&rsquo;s location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies.
</p>

<p>
To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once.

For example, you might learn that the target&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name is Jarn, the father lives on a nearby farm, and the target and his father don&rsquo;t get along.
</p>

<p>
Since this spell reads the target&rsquo;s mind, you can learn only what the target knows or believes.

<i>Discharge</i> dissipates the charges from one technical object, temporarily depowers one electrically powered technological object that does not use charges, or severely hinders a creature with the robot subtype. If the spell targets an object with charges, the object loses all of its remaining charges. If the object is powered by electrical means other than charges, its functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds. If the spell targets a creature not of the robot subtype, it affects a random charged or electrically powered item in that creature&rsquo;s possession. If the target is a robot, the robot is staggered and cannot use any energy-based attacks for 1d4 rounds. A robot that&rsquo;s affected by this spell receives a new saving throw at the end of each round to shrug off the effect.

A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6).

Pulsing, bronze energy surrounds you, bestowing three effects.

Second, upon making a successful melee touch attack against a creature from another plane with a neutral component to its alignment, you can choose to banish that creature back to its home plane.

You can use <i>dispel magic</i> to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster&rsquo;s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The of a spell with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.
</p>

<p>
You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.
</p>

<table class=Options
<tr>
	<th>	Targeted Dispel:
	<td>	One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level). If successful, that spell ends.
</p>

<p>
If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.
</p>

<p>
For example, a 7th-level caster casts <i>dispel magic</i>, targeting a creature affected by <i>stoneskin</i> (caster level 12th) and <i>fly</i> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the <i>stoneskin</i> (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the <i>fly</i> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the <i>stoneskin</i> would have been dispelled, leaving the <i>fly</i> intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.
</p>

<p>
You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of fire</i>). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.
</p>

<p>
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
</p>

<p>
If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item&rsquo;s caster level (DC = 11 + the item&rsquo;s caster level). If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a <i>bag of</i> holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item&rsquo;s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
</p>

<p>
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.
</p>

<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Counterspell:
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Minor Image">minor image</a></i>, except it always creates an animated illusion of you presenting to a vampire a material, object, or sound that it is averse to, such as garlic, a holy symbol, or bells ringing. You specify what aversion the illusion depicts when you cast the spell. The vampire reacts to the illusion as if it were real; it can overcome the effect by succeeding at a disbelief save or a normal Will save against the illusion&rsquo;s DC (instead of the normal DC 25 to overcome its revulsion).

<p>
You touch a Tiny or smaller item, causing the item to vanish as if it did not exist at all. The item doesn&rsquo;t take damage or otherwise gain any condition; it simply ceases to be visible to or interact with the world in any way, as if it no longer existed. The oil vanishes with the item and leaves no residue, nor does it affect surfaces that handle or hold the item during its application. No spell or ability short of <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> can locate or affect the item while it is under the effect of this spell. Though the item seems to not exist while under the effects of this spell, its own reality is consistent (it ages normally, and any ongoing effects upon it continue normally). The target object can be one size larger than Tiny for every 5 caster levels above 5th you possess.
</p>

<p>
The target item returns to existence when the spell&rsquo;s duration expires. An item returns to existence in exactly the same location and condition it left. If the location no longer has room for the item, the item takes 1d0 points of damage (bypassing hardness) and is teleported to the nearest location that has room for it. If that location is more than 5 feet from the original location, there is a 25% chance the item is instead shifted to a randomly determined alternate plane.

Similar to <i>augury</i> but more powerful, a <i>divination</i> spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn&rsquo;t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct <i>divination</i> is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.

This spell allows you to enchant the targeted animal and direct it with simple commands such as &ldquo;Attack,&rdquo; &ldquo;Run,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fetch.&rdquo; Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger than the dominated animal) are simply ignored.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dominate animal</i> establishes a mental link between you and the subject creature. The animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the creature to control it. You do not receive direct sensory input from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own comprehension. You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn&rsquo;t do. Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.

<p>
You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stand still.&rdquo; You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
</p>

<p>
Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject&rsquo;s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).
</p>

<p>
Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.
</p>

<p>
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can&rsquo;t communicate with you. You can&rsquo;t actually see through the subject&rsquo;s eyes, so it&rsquo;s not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what&rsquo;s going on.
</p>

<p>
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.
</p>

<p>
If you don&rsquo;t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.
</p>

<p>
<i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Detect Thoughts">detect thoughts</a></i>, with the additional ability to find echoes of the thoughts of a creature mentally controlling the target. For example, if the target has been dominated by a vampire, you can use evidence left in the target&rsquo;s mind to learn about that vampire. Each minute you concentrate on the spell, you can learn your choice of one of the following pieces of information.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Direction:
	<td>	The controller&rsquo;s general direction and distance.
<tr>
	<th>	Emotion:
	<td>	The controller&rsquo;s emotional state (gloating, sated, frightened, angry, and so on).
<tr>
	<th>	Image:
	<td>	A powerful iconic image relevant to the controller or its connection to the target, such as a symbol on a door or a name on a gravestone.
<tr>
	<th>	Location: The controller&rsquo;s general location, such as &ldquo;in a large city&rdquo; or &ldquo;on a ship.&rdquo;
<tr>
	<th>	Name:
	<td>	The name by which the target knows its controller (if any).
</table>

<p>
All of this information is based on the last time the influencing creature linked itself to the target, either to issue a command or to receive sensory input from the target. For example, if at nightfall a vampire commanded a dominated victim to walk to a cemetery, this spell can reveal the vampire&rsquo;s general location at that time, though it may have moved since then.

You create an alchemical residue on your hands that allows you to reshape any nonmagical, unattended object with hardness 19 or less as though it were clay. Objects with hardness 9 or less are like soft clay, allowing you to reshape up to 1 cubic foot per round of effort. Objects with hardness 10 or higher are harder to mold, allowing you to reshape up to 1/4 cubic foot per round. The object retains its new shape for 24 hours before returning to its original shape. This spell does not allow you to reshape a portion of a large object, such as a wall; you must be able to reshape the entire target within the spell&rsquo;s duration or the spell fizzles and has no effect.

With a beckoning gesture, you call forth a downpour of rain. For the duration of the spell, the following effects apply within the affected area. Nonmagical fires are automatically extinguished, and all creatures and objects in the area gain fire resistance 5. The conjured water is conductive, and whenever a doused creature takes electricity damage, it takes 1 additional point of electricity damage. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, the fire resistance increases by 5 and the additional electricity damage increases by 1 point.

Treat this servant as a pseudodragon with all of the abilities granted by one of the following spells: <i><a href="#Form of the Alien Dragon I">form of the alien dragon I</a></i>, <i><a href="#Form of the Dragon I">form of the dragon I</a></i>, or <i><a href="#Form of the Exotic Dragon I">form of the exotic dragon I</a></i>. Your <i>draconic ally</i> can use its breath weapon once per day. Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell&rsquo;s range, and can go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command. The <i>draconic ally</i> speaks one language of your choice that you know. You cannot have more than one <i>draconic ally</i> at a time. As long as a previous ally exists, you cannot successfully cast this spell again. If you have a breath weapon, you can cast this spell as a standard action by expending one use of your breath weapon as a free action when you cast the spell.

<i>Draconic reservoir</i> functions as <i><a href="#Protection from Energy">protection from energy</a></i>, absorbing 6 points of one type of energy damage per caster level (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, maximum 60 points). Each round, as a swift action, the subject can release 1d6 points of the absorbed energy and apply it to any melee attack, as if using an <i>acidic</i>, <i>flaming</i>, <i>frost</i>, or <i>shock</i> weapon. The first creature the subject strikes with this attack takes the energy damage in addition to any other consequences of the attack.
</p>

<p>
Releasing energy in this way does not &ldquo;free up&rdquo; space to absorb still more energy; the maximum amount of energy the spell can absorb remains fixed. The subject cannot release more energy than he currently has absorbed. Once the subject has absorbed all the energy allowed by the spell, he takes damage as normal from that energy type. Once the energy has been released, the spell is discharged.

By touching a weapon against the fang of a poisonous creature and casting this spell, you drain 1 dose of the creature&rsquo;s poison, which is magically applied to your weapon without risk of poisoning yourself. The poison remains on the weapon until either it strikes a creature, you touch the weapon, or you wipe off the poison. It otherwise functions exactly like a dose of a manufactured poison applied to a weapon. You can use this spell with natural as well as manufactured weapons. This spell does not prevent you from exposing yourself to the poison if you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll while the poison is applied to your weapon.

The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient&rsquo;s dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.
</p>

<p>
Once the message is delivered, the messenger&rsquo;s mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient&rsquo;s dream and deliver the message.
</p>

<p>
If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance.
</p>

<p>
The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient&rsquo;s dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell.
</p>

<p>
Creatures who don&rsquo;t sleep or don&rsquo;t dream cannot be contacted by this spell.
</p>

<p>
The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always failing any saving throw) while in the trance.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Dream">dream</a></i>, but you and the target of your <i>dream</i> can converse in a limited fashion as long as the recipient is also asleep. You can send or receive a number of dream messages equal to your caster level. Each message can be up to 25 words long or a single vague image that can&rsquo;t convey fine details such as words. You can send and receive these dream messages with a single target or multiple targets, but each message you send or receive counts against the total number of messages allowed. Sending a message takes 1 round. The spell ends and you wake up when you run out of messages.
</p>

<p>
If you use <i>dream council</i> to send a message to a sleeping creature that has <i>dream</i> or <i>dream council</i> prepared (or is able to cast it spontaneously or as a spell-like ability), the recipient can expend one of your allotted messages to cast that spell while remaining asleep. This uses up that creature&rsquo;s prepared spell, spell per day, or spell-like ability use as normal. Instead of replying to your message, that character is able to enter your dreamscape. If the sleeping recipient has the Lucid Dreamer feat, it can enter your dreamscape without casting either of those spells. While in the original caster&rsquo;s dreamscape, those involved in the council can interact with one another and that dreamscape for 10 minutes for each message remaining. When that time elapses, the spell ends.

<p>
You create a comforting phantasm, which leeches onto the psyche of a nearby target. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the phantasm from entering its psyche, but otherwise it takes up permanent residence in the creature&rsquo;s mind. The phantasm fills its target&rsquo;s dreams with happy visions, comforting manifestations of loved ones, and incredible vistas, feeding the target a perfect fantasy life it never wishes to leave. After the target&rsquo;s next night&rsquo;s sleep, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw to wake up; otherwise, it remains asleep for the rest of the day and following night. Each night it must succeed at a new saving throw or remain asleep for days or weeks on end as it slowly starves to death (presuming it normally needs to eat to survive). Loud noises, jostling, and even pain won&rsquo;t rouse the slumbering target. Dealing 1 point of damage per the target&rsquo;s Hit Die awakens the target, but it awakens fatigued and takes a &minus;2 penalty on all saving throws against spells and effects that may put it back to sleep until the phantasm has been banished.
</p>

<p>
The phantasm remains in its host&rsquo;s mind indefinitely, requiring a new Will saving throw to wake up every time the target rests, until it is removed via <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>greater restoration</i>, or <i>miracle</i>. Alternatively, the phantasm can be confronted in its host&rsquo;s mindscape, where it manifests as a slothful duplicate of its host with identical abilities, skills, and attributes.

The next time the target sleeps (within the next 8 hours), she dreams of a rich feast with her favorite foods and drinks. When she awakens, she is sated as if she had eaten a nutritious meal, regardless of what she dreamed she ate. The target must sleep for at least 1 hour to gain the benefits of this spell. Being awakened during this period interrupts the spell and cancels its effects.
</p>

<p>
If you sleep with this spell prepared, you may automatically expend it while you sleep to gain the spell&rsquo;s benefit. This expenditure does not count as spellcasting for the purpose of determining available spell slots (you could go to sleep at midnight, expend this spell during an 8-hour period of sleep, and still prepare your full allotment of spells in the morning).

You cause the target to perceive the world as if in a dream. When the spell ends, the target forgets all identifying details of events that transpired while the spell lasted. The memories were not taken from it; rather, its mind never recorded the memories as real in the first place. If <i>modify memory</i> is cast upon it before the spell ends, the target remembers these events. A target under the effect of <i>lullaby</i> before this spell is cast applies its penalty to the saving throw against this spell.

<p>
This spell functions as <i><a href="#Dream">dream</a></i>, but rather than sending a message to a sleeping target, you can instead read the target&rsquo;s thoughts. The target must be asleep for you to perform a <i>dream scan</i>, though if the target isn&rsquo;t asleep, you can wait in a trance until your target falls asleep. Once the target is asleep, you can concentrate in order to read its surface thoughts as if using <i><a href="#Detect Thoughts">detect thoughts</a></i>. You can continue concentrating for up to 1 minute per caster level.
</p>

<p>
Instead of reading surface thoughts, you can choose to scan the target&rsquo;s dreams and subconscious mind for the answers to questions. For every minute you spend concentrating, you can obtain the answer to one question, though the answers might be brief, cryptic, or repetitive. The target is entitled to a new Will save to end the <i>dream scan</i> each time you ask it a question. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11 + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the information you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds at its check by 5 or more, you misinterpret the target&rsquo;s dreams&mdash;you draw a false conclusion of the target&rsquo;s choice and believe that wrong answer to be true.
</p>

<p>
Unlike with <i>dream</i>, you can&rsquo;t cast this spell on another creature to have it serve as your messenger.

<p>
You ward the target&rsquo;s mind against intrusion and influence while she is unconscious. While sleeping, the target is protected against divinations as with <i><a href="#Nondetection">nondetection</a></i> and gains spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level against mind-affecting effects. In addition, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spell or effect that would possess or exercise direct mental control over her. This functions in all respects like the second property of <i><a href="#Protection from Evil">protection from evil</a></i> but it applies regardless of the alignment of the creature or object that created the possession or mental influence effect.
</p>

<p>
If the target is awake, instead of the previous effects, the <i>dream shield</i> provides a +4 bonus on saving throws against sleep effects. The spell&rsquo;s other effects are suppressed while the target is awake. If the target falls asleep or is otherwise rendered unconscious, the other effects of the <i>dream shield</i> resume. Every 10 minutes spent awake consumes 1 hour of the <i>dream shield</i>&rsquo;s duration.

You and the other targets of the spell are physically drawn from the Material Plane into the Dimension of Dreams on a voyage into the dreams of a creature you designate. In the Dimension of Dreams, you move through a swirling sea of thoughts, desires, and emotions created by the minds of dreamers everywhere to reach your destination dreamscape. Reaching the destination dreamscape takes 1 hour. At any point before the spell&rsquo;s duration ends, you can dismiss the spell to return to where you started on the Material Plane. The connection between dreams and reality is inherently tenuous, and your ability to arrive precisely where you mean to is dependent on your familiarity with the dreamer you&rsquo;re trying to find. To determine how accurate your arrival is at the end of your <i>dream travel</i>, roll d% on the following table.

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;False identity&rdquo; means that whether or not you have met the creature, you know it only through a false identity. When trying to locate the dreamscape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct dreamscape.

<p>
Regardless of the accuracy of your <i>dream travel</i>, you and your companions all arrive at the same location (except in the case of a mishap). Mindless creatures can&rsquo;t use <i>dream travel</i>, nor can creatures that can&rsquo;t dream.
</p>

<p>
You might be able to exit the dream near the creature on its home plane. If you and the other creatures are still in a dream when the dreamer wakes up, the dreamer can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another dreamscape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the dreamer awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.
</p>

<p>
You can use <i>dream travel</i> to travel to the dream of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the dreams of outsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination dream, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomes shaken for the remainder of the <i>dream travel</i> and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using <i>dream travel</i> to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply.

Traveling to a different planar destination decreases the accuracy of your dream transit. If you exit a creature&rsquo;s dream onto a plane different from the plane you started on, you end up in a random location on the destination plane.
<p>

<p>
If the target of your <i>dream travel</i> isn&rsquo;t dreaming, you and the other travelers can wait on the Dimension of Dreams until that creature begins sleeping. For each hour that passes during this wait, each dream traveler must attempt a Will save as if it were traveling to reach another plane.

<p>
This spell functions as <i><a href="#Dream Travel">dream travel</a></i>, but you and your companions travel through the Dimension of Dreams in a fantastical vehicle of your own devising that halves the travel time. Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren&rsquo;t inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to harmful emotion and fear effects. Unlike with <i>dream travel</i>, there is no chance the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However, if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you do need to roll, using the false identity entry from <i>dream travel</i>.
</p>

<p>
Creatures that disembark from your vehicle can either enter the dreamscape or exit to the plane where the dreamer&rsquo;s body lies, arriving within 1 mile of the dreamer&rsquo;s body. All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The dreamer can&rsquo;t prevent the dream voyagers from entering its dream, but can attempt a Will save to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.
</p>

<p>
The psychic vehicle remains in the dream for the remainder of the spell&rsquo;s duration, even if it&rsquo;s unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the dreamer can reenter the dream vessel as a full-round action through an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast <i>dream voyage</i> to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the dream again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell&rsquo;s duration. If the vessel moves out of a dreamscape, companions left behind can&rsquo;t return to the vessel by being near the dreamer. If a companion is killed, its body doesn&rsquo;t return to the <i>dream voyage</i> unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.
</p>

<p>
If the dreamer awakens while the dream vessel is still in its dream, it can allow the dream travelers to exit or not (as with <i>dream travel</i>). The dream vessel remains intact in the Dimension of Dreams for the spell&rsquo;s duration even if it&rsquo;s untethered from a dream. It drifts through dreams when this happens, and you can&rsquo;t pilot it to another dream (even a dream of the initial dreamer if that creature begins dreaming again). If you dismiss the spell at any time, you and all subjects within the dream vessel return to where you started on the Material Plane.
</p>

<p>
You can increase the number of companions you can bring on a <i>dream voyage</i> to 10 creatures per caster level, though to do so you must increase the casting time, maintaining your concentration and touching up to 6 creatures per round as a full-round action. If your concentration is disrupted before you touch all of the targets, the spell is wasted and has no effect. Once you have touched all of your companions, the <i>dream voyage</i> begins; however, its duration is reduced to 1 hour.

You cause the flesh and bones of a corpse to shift themselves to suit a narrative of your choosing. This spell can hide or create telltale wounds, bruising, and other subtle clues as to the nature of the target&rsquo;s death, and the final hours leading up to it, allowing you to make the corpse appear to have died in just about any way. You could, for example, make stab wounds close up as though they were never there, rearrange bruises on the neck, evaporate traces of poison within the body into nothingness, make burn marks grow to cover the corpse&rsquo;s skin, or shrivel the target&rsquo;s body as though the creature had starved. This spell can&rsquo;t hide extreme alterations to the body (such as the loss of a limb), nor can it restore flesh to a skeletal corpse or strip a corpse down to skeletal form. It is also unable to change the apparent identity of the corpse.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who closely examines the corpse can attempt a Perception check (DC = 10 + your caster level) to notice that the corpse&rsquo;s wounds (or lack thereof) don&rsquo;t look natural, but this doesn&rsquo;t allow the observer to determine what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast. Closely examining the corpse with a successful Heal check (DC = 15 + your caster level) not only reveals that the target&rsquo;s apparent wounds are false, but also what the originally obscured wounds were.

This spell emanates from your mouth and functions like <i><a href="#Stinking Cloud">stinking cloud</a></i>, except as noted above. The effect is barely visible and does not obscure vision. The nausea effect resembles that of an extreme hangover. This is a poison effect. Cayden Cailean&rsquo;s church uses this spell to disperse angry crowds, such as when celebrations get out of hand.

You receive a clear and memorable view of the layout of chambers, barriers, and connecting passages within the area of effect. This spell does not reveal the contents or inhabitants of any of these locations, only the basic architecture of the space. For example, a staircase leading up to a pair of doors would be apparent, but the iron golems guarding the doors would not. This spell does identify the locations of secret doors and hidden passages but gives no clue as to the means of opening or accessing them.

Upon casting this spell, you keep your relative form, but you and your equipment become composed entirely of dust. While in this dust form, you take no penalties for squeezing, and can move through spaces as if you were a creature three size categories smaller without penalty. You are also considered incorporeal, though any nonmagical attack you make deals half damage (50%). Magic attacks are unaffected, and you can still use your magic items and other equipment as normal.

You ward a magic item against other creatures who try to learn to use or copy it. When you cast the spell, you designate one creature type, subtype, or a specific individual. If the item is worn or carried for 1 continuous hour or more by a creature that doesn&rsquo;t match the designation, the <i>dust ward</i> disintegrates the item into worthless gray dust. This destruction also occurs if the creature attempts to study the item in order to learn its properties or how to magically craft it (a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> spell used on the gray dust can still reveal this information). The destruction of the item doesn&rsquo;t harm the creature wearing or carrying the item (although the item&rsquo;s destruction may put the creature in harm&rsquo;s way, such as if a magical rope were being used to cross a chasm at the time). If the offending creature wears or carries the item for less than 1 hour and passes it to a different creature, the countdown to the item&rsquo;s destruction starts over.

The spell cannot affect a magic item with a caster level greater than half your caster level.

You may only cast this spell immediately after successfully counterspelling an opponent.

<p>
As the Inner Sea&rsquo;s bravest men and women answered the call of what became the Second Mendevian Crusade, constructing the <i>wardstones</i> that eventually kept the brutal chaos of the Worldwound at bay, they realized that they needed help beyond traditional magics.
</p>

<p>
Legends say that the first <i>eaglesoul</i> spell was created when an agathion avoral joined his own spirit with that of a courageous paladin who was about to be overwhelmed on the field of battle. The holy knight used the combined might of the agathion&rsquo;s great strength and his own to win the day for the crusaders. Now, although the spell is still in use chiefly among those that patrol the borders of the Worldwound, other champions of good have carried it with them to all corners of the Inner Sea region.
</p>

<p>
When you cast this spell, you reach into the great beyond and beseech a good-aligned outsider for their aid against evil.
</p>

<p>
The outsider infuses a small portion of its own power into you, making you a powerful force for good. You gain a +2 morale bonus on all Perception checks made against evil creatures, a +2 bonus on Initiative checks, and <i><a href="#Detect Evil">detect evil</a></i> as a constant spell-like ability.
</p>

<p>
In addition, once during the spell&rsquo;s duration you can call forth a surge of holy power when fighting an evil creature.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Doing so is a swift action that shortens the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration so that its remaining hours of duration become rounds of duration. For the rest of this duration, the surge of power grants you the following benefits:
<ul>
	<li>	A +2 sacred bonus to AC
	<li>	A +4 sacred bonus to Strength
	<li>	Resistance 5 to acid and fire
	<li>	A +5 sacred bonus on all Intimidate checks made against evil creatures
	<li>	Fast healing 2
	<li>	Any critical threat roll made against an evil creature with a weapon you wield is automatically confirmed.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Although this surge of power can be activated against any evil opponent, this ability activates automatically as soon as you attack any evil outsider, regardless of whether you hit or not, and regardless of whether you actually recognize that the target is in fact an evil outsider. In such cases the activation is a free action.
</p>

<p>
Nongood spellcasters can cast this spell, but doing so causes them to be sickened (for spellcasters who are neither good nor evil) or staggered (for spellcasters who are evil) for the spell&rsquo;s duration.

If the target is good-aligned, it is fascinated for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is neutral-aligned, it is confused for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is evil-aligned, it is shaken for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.

The target of this spell sees and hears a stream of past scenes and pieces of conversations related to local people and events. The flashes are so brief that it is impossible to identify individual people or places, but when the target concentrates on a particular topic or individual, she can piece together a coherent narrative told in a multitude of changing voices in her mind.
</p>

<p>
Each round for the duration of the spell, the target can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information as though she had spent 1d4 hours talking to local people. Since the information gathering doesn&rsquo;t involve actual interaction with people, only observation, the target can use her Perception skill instead of her Diplomacy skill. While thus concentrating, the target is effectively blind and deaf.

The target can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water, traveling at a speed of 5 feet. If protected against fire damage, it can move through lava. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. It requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally, but cannot charge or run. Casting <i>move earth</i> on an area containing the target flings the target back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates). This spell does not give the target the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through solid material, the creature must hold its breath.

When you cast <i>earthquake</i>, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can&rsquo;t move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The <i>earthquake</i> affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an <i>earthquake</i> spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.

At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Chapter 13 for more details).

	<th>	Structure:
	<td>	Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.  Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble; see below.
<tr>
	<th>	River, Lake, or Marsh:
	<td>	Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.

<p>
<i>Pinned Beneath Rubble</i>: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

You call into being around you an invisible barrier of force within which magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed and creatures are affected as by <i><a href="#Antimagic Field">antimagic field</a></i>. An immobile sphere of impenetrable force surrounds the field, equivalent in all ways to a spherical <i><a href="#Wall of Force">wall of force</a></i>, including its immunity to <i>dispel magic</i> and vulnerability to a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> or <i>rod of cancellation</i>. The barrier has hardness 40 and 20 hit points per caster level, and can be damaged by both mundane attacks and spells cast from outside the field. If the bubble of force is destroyed, the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.
</p>

<p>
Spells cannot be cast within, into, or out of the enclosure, and teleportation effects that ignore a <i>wall of force</i> (such as <i>dimension door</i> or teleport) are thwarted by the enclosure&rsquo;s field of antimagic.
</p>

<p>
<i>Echean&rsquo;s excellent enclosure</i> has the same effect on summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead that an <i>antimagic field</i> does, causing them to wink out of existence for the duration of <i>Echean&rsquo;s excellent enclosure</i> unless their spell resistance, if any, allows them to remain where they are within the field.

You cause a sound heard in the target area up to 1 round ago and lasting up to 1 round in duration to repeat at a regular interval. The original sound need not have come from the area, but it echoes from the target area at its original full volume. Any special effects of the sound are not duplicated by this spell. If the area is naturally prone to echoes, such as a space surrounded on at least two sides by cliffs or high river banks, the spell&rsquo;s range is long. Otherwise, the spell&rsquo;s range is close.
</p>

<p>
You can concentrate as a standard action to alter the echo. You can change it to be any sound audible in the area within the last 1 round, move the apparent source of the sound within the area, or attempt a Bluff check to create a distraction to hide with a bonus equal to your caster level.

A cascading avalanche of pale, swirling ectoplasmic matter erupts from a point you select. All creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage and are entangled for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This spell passes between planes, so it affects ethereal and incorporeal creatures normally.
</p>

<p>
In addition, each ethereal or incorporeal creature in the area must succeed at a Will save or be pushed partially onto the Material Plane for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. It must attempt this Will save regardless of whether it succeeded at the Reflex save. An incorporeal creature pushed partially onto the Material Plane can&rsquo;t enter or pass through solid objects, takes half damage from nonmagical attack forms, and takes full damage from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. Corporeal spells and effects that don&rsquo;t cause damage affect the creature normally instead of having a 50% chance of affecting it. The creature still gains the other benefits of being incorporeal, and retains its attack bonuses and Armor Class.

You draw forth a ghostly, animated hand through the ectoplasmic veil to manipulate objects, attack creatures, and deliver touch spells at a distance. The hand remains tethered to you by tendrils of ectoplasm. The <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> and its tether have hardness 10 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. The tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length, ending the spell. The <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> has improved evasion, uses your save bonuses, and has an AC of 24 (+6 natural armor, +8 size). The <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> moves up to 30 feet per round, and on each of your turns you can spend a move action to move it an additional 30 feet. If you spend a swift action, the <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> can make an attack using your base attack bonus, modifying its attack rolls and damage rolls with your spellcasting ability score (the ability score that determines your spell save DCs). It deals 1d6 points of damage with a slam attack, and it can wield any light or one-handed weapon. The <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> threatens and can flank targets.

It can pull levers, open unstuck doors, or knock over objects. If the <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> must attempt a Strength check, it uses your spellcasting ability score as its Strength score.

<p>
You unleash a writhing tendril of ectoplasm to grapple or entangle a target creature. You must make a ranged touch attack to strike a target. If you hit, the target can attempt a Reflex save. On a successful save, the target is entangled for the duration of the spell and suffers no other effects. If the target fails this saving throw, the tendril is more restrictive, making the target grappled and dealing it 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. Each round when you concentrate to maintain the spell, the snare attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple. As normal when grappling, the snare gains a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents it is already grappling. The snare&rsquo;s CMB is equal to 6 + your caster level, and its CMD is equal to 16 + your caster level. Since the ectoplasm passes between planes, this spell affects incorporeal and ethereal creatures normally.
</p>

<p>
You remain tethered to the target for the duration of the spell. You can shrink or extend the snare, but if the distance between you and the target exceeds the spell&rsquo;s range, the snare disappears. The ectoplasmic tether has hardness 10 and a number of hit points equal to 10 + your caster level + your Constitution modifier, and the tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length. You are not considered to have the grappled condition while tethered to the target. You can perform the move or damage action on a successfully grappled target, moving it up to half your speed or dealing an additional 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage to it on a successful grapple combat maneuver check. You can&rsquo;t pin your target.

Originally created by a disciple of the archwizard Nex, this spell was used to turn enemy soldiers in Geb&rsquo;s undead armies into conduits capable of blasting spell energy back into the far reaches of the Gebite lines. Since then, it has become a favorite among arcane casters with an understanding of battlefield tactics.

<p>
If the target of this spell fails to resist its effects with a Will save, he becomes outlined in faint radiance, as if via <i><a href="#Faerie Fire">faerie fire</a></i>. At any time before the <i>eldritch conduit</i> expires, you may cast another spell with an area effect of cone, cylinder, line, or sphere and use the subject of the <i>eldritch conduit</i> as the point of origin for that spell. Doing so ends the spell immediately. The target must be within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) in order for you to use the conduit&mdash;if the target moves out of range, the <i>eldritch conduit</i> effect persists but cannot be utilized by you until you get back within range.

You summon elementals from their elemental planes and hurl them onto your enemies with great force. You must have line of effect to a point at least 60 feet above your intended targets and within the spell&rsquo;s range. You can summon one greater elemental, two Huge elementals, four Large elementals, or eight Medium elementals. You aim the elementals at targets within 60 feet of each other, no more than one elemental per target.
</p>

<p>
Each elemental can strike only a single target, regardless of its size. When an elemental strikes a target, it makes a single slam attack at its full attack bonus with a +4 circumstance bonus. The elemental deals damage according to the table below. The type and amount of damage dealt varies by the size and type of elemental (see the table). Some elementals inflict an additional special ability upon successfully hitting a target; these additional special abilities are detailed in the elemental&rsquo;s full stat block and are denoted with an asterisk (*). Whether or not it hits, the elemental takes bludgeoning damage according to its size. A summoned elemental acts on the same turn that it lands, starting prone in the nearest available space adjacent to its target.

You must select one type of elemental to summon when casting this spell (see the table).

This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. A druid can choose any plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain.
</p>

<p>
When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.
</p>

<p>
The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.

You transform one melee weapon into a burning glaive similar to the ones wielded by the runelords of old. The target of your spell must be a masterwork or magical melee weapon appropriate to your size. The weapon becomes a glaive appropriate to your size and has a +1 enhancement bonus and the <i>flaming</i> weapon special ability. When wielding the glaive, you are considered proficient with it and use your caster level as your base attack bonus (which may give you multiple attacks). When you reach caster level 14th, the glaive gains the <i>spell-storing</i> weapon special ability. When you reach caster level 17th, it loses the <i>flaming</i> weapon special ability, and gains the <i>flaming burst</i> weapon special ability. The glaive&rsquo;s enhancement bonus increases to +2 at caster level 15th, and +3 at caster level 19th.
</p>

<p>
If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with <i>greater magic weapon</i> or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon&rsquo;s bonus on attack rolls does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.

As <i><a href="#Wall of Force">wall of force</a></i>, except you create a hemispherical dome of force with hardness 20 and a number of hit points equal to 10 per caster level. The bottom edge of the dome forms a relatively watertight space if you are standing on a reasonably flat surface. The dome shape means that falling debris (such as rocks from a collapsing ceiling) tend to tumble to the side and pile up around the base of the dome. If you make a DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry), Knowledge (engineering), or Profession (architect or engineer) check, the debris is stable enough that it retains its dome-like configuration when the spell ends, otherwise it collapses.

You make a conduit between the targeted master and her familiar, allowing you to target the master or the familiar with your spells in order to affect the other. If the master succeeds at its save to resist this spell but the familiar fails, you can choose to have your spells that target the master affect the familiar instead. If the familiar resists but the master doesn&rsquo;t, your spells that target the familiar can affect the master instead. If both the familiar and the master fail to resist this spell, you can affect either the familiar or the master when you target either with a spell. When you target the master to affect her familiar or vice versa, the target attempts a save (if one is allowed) with its own saving throw bonus, but the other creature is affected by the spell.
</p>

<p>
Only spells that target one or more creatures can be cast through <i>empathy conduit</i>. The creature to be affected must still be a valid target of the spell being cast; for example, you can&rsquo;t affect a familiar with <i>charm person</i> through an <i>empathy conduit</i>. Spells with a duration other than instantaneous that are cast through an <i>empathy conduit</i> last either their normal duration or until the <i>empathy conduit</i> expires, whichever comes first. Whenever the master or its familiar is targeted with a spell intended to affect the other creature, the targeted creature can attempt an additional save against the <i>empathy conduit</i>.

When thrown at an undead creature, the affected vial of holy water deals an amount of bonus damage equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on a direct hit, and half that amount of bonus damage (maximum +5) to creatures caught in the splash area.

Your irises take on a purplish tinge and you can see whether creatures within 60 feet of you are affected by an enchantment effect. To your eyes only, a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell glows with a simple white light around its head. You can immediately discern whether the brightness of the light is faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming depending on the highest spell level of enchantment currently in effect (as per <i><a href="#Detect Magic">detect magic</a></i>). Enchantments of the charm or compulsion subschool glow with a scarlet or emerald hue, respectively.
</p>

If a creature under an enchantment effect is in your line of sight, you can attempt a Spellcraft check as a move action to determine the highest-level spell or spell effect (DC = 15 + the spell level, or 15 + &frac12; the caster level for a non-spell effect). Effects that block divination magic also block this spell.

You grab a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby opponents or objects. You must target a specific creature when casting this spell and once you select that creature you cannot switch to another. Each round, as a standard action, you can attempt to hurl the target at any creature or object within 30 feet of it. You must make an attack roll whenever you use the target as a weapon. The attack bonus for this attack is equal to your caster level plus either your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). If you successfully hit the new target with the creature both it and the creature take damage based on the creature&rsquo;s size.

The target creature can make a Fortitude saving throw each time you attempt to use it as a weapon. If it makes its saving throw it can act normally, but if it fails its save it loses all actions for the round and ends its turn prone in a square adjacent to the target of your attack. However, if the creature chooses to resist your efforts to move it, taking no other actions for the round, it gets a +4 circumstance bonus on its saving throw. The spell ends immediately if the target creature dies or is destroyed.

This spell transforms any ammunition fired by the target ranged siege engine into ammunition made of pure energy. When casting the spell, the caster picks a one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, or force. The ammunition within the siege weapon now deals that type of energy damage on a hit, though the amount of damage dealt by the ammunition does not change, nor does it change any of the other effects of the ammunition. Unlike other forms of energy damage, this energy damage does full damage to objects. Based on the type of energy the caster chose while casting, the ammunition also gains one of the following effects.

This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature&rsquo;s size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a &minus;2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a &minus;1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.
</p>

<p>
A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target&rsquo;s speed.
</p>

<p>
If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it&mdash;the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
</p>

<p>
All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature&rsquo;s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.
</p>

<p>
Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

You become warded against the mental prying of others, including the effects of divination spells such as <i>detect thoughts</i> and <i>seek thoughts</i>, as well as enchantment spells such as <i>modify memory</i> and <i>memory lapse</i>.

This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures that fail their save gain the entangled condition. Creatures that make their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of your turn. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail must end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.
</p>

<p>
If the plants in the area are covered in thorns, those in the area take 1 point of damage each time they fail a save against the <i>entangle</i> or fail a check made to break free. Other effects, depending on the local plants, might be possible at GM discretion.

<p>
You gain a dim impression of the activities around any object bearing your face or form and can also project your consciousness into one such object at a time, allowing you to observe or even interact with nearby creatures. This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception check to notice it.
</p>

<p>
You may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own body&rsquo;s surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action.
</p>

<p>
When you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance.
</p>

<p>
Portraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image.
</p>

<p>
You may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it. If someone destroys or damages the image you return to your body unharmed. The spell lasts until you cease concentrating, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as a <i>dispel magic</i> cast upon either the image or your body, or if your body is killed.

If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold them enthralled. To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell. Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw.
</p>

<p>
A target with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes.
</p>

<p>
The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing.
</p>

<p>
If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist. The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.
</p>

<p>
If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously enthralled members become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Lesser Planar Ally">lesser planar ally</a></i>, except that you entice a fey of 6 HD or fewer to lend you its aid with an offering of music or something else it finds appealing. Like <i>lesser planar ally</i>, this spell is unpredictable, and the fey who answers the calling is up to the whims of nature and the fey, not your own choice. You must succeed at a Knowledge (nature) check or Perform check (DC = 20 + target&rsquo;s HD) in addition to the spell&rsquo;s material component to entice the fey into appearing, after which you can negotiate for the service and your payment. The maximum HD of fey that you can call with that casting is equal to the result of your check &minus; 20. For example, if your check result is a 24, the maximum HD for the called fey is 4. A high result doesn&rsquo;t allow you to break the HD maximum for the spell, and a result of 20 or less means you can&rsquo;t call a fey at all. If the fey doesn&rsquo;t like the sound of your offer, it can simply choose to refuse, in which case you don&rsquo;t expend any of the material components for the spell, either the offerings or the payment.

A targeted creature that fails its saving throw is filled with a deep desire to protect and care for you, fawning over your needs and ensuring your comfort. If another creature harms you, the target is immediately overcome with rage and is compelled to attack the aggressor, gaining a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a &minus;2 penalty to its Armor Class. These bonuses last until the instigating creature is defeated or retreats, or the target of the spell is killed or rendered unconscious. If other creatures have harmed you while the target is under this effect, the target continues to rage until all threats against you are defeated or driven off, after which the target creature is fatigued for as many rounds as it raged. Your target continues to fly into defensive rages each time a creature harms you so long as the spell&rsquo;s duration lasts, but cannot rage while fatigued.
</p>

<p>
If you are reduced below 0 hit points by an attack, the target creature must succeed at a second Will save or be compelled to defend your body, attacking anyone who comes near, for the remainder of the spell&rsquo;s duration. If the creature succeeds at this second save, the spell immediately ends.

<p>
You designate an aboveground area and send it deep within the earth. During the casting of this spell, the chosen area is rocked by minor tremors that alert nearby creatures to the impending danger. Once the spell is complete, the chosen area is drawn into the earth and buried in a self-contained vault, with the uppermost point at a depth of up to 10 feet per caster level below the surface. The surrounding atmosphere and all creatures within the selected area at the end of the spell&rsquo;s casting time are entombed in this vault.
</p>

<p>
The magic of the vault maintains the natural light, temperature, and air quality of the area as it originally existed aboveground, but any magical effects that affected these qualities do not have their duration extended. For example, a sunny field would remain brightly lit indefinitely, despite being buried underground, while a <i>daylight</i> spell would expire at the end of that spell&rsquo;s duration.
</p>

<p>
When creating the vault, you can leave a tunnel to the surface world (up to 20 feet wide), or you can completely isolate the vault from the outside world. Casting this spell does not destroy or damage anything that may have existed in the ground where you choose to place this vault, but instead pushes it farther down into the earth. Should your vault be dispelled, the entombed area returns to the surface, and anything that may have been displaced by the vault returns to its original place. If there is something already on the surface that blocks the vault&rsquo;s path, the vault pushes it harmlessly aside when returning.

The target contracts one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom, as the spell <i><a href="#Contagion">contagion</a></i>. However, the disease is highly contagious, and any creature that touches the infected target, is touched by the target, or spends more than an hour in a confined space with the target must make a save against the disease&rsquo;s normal DC (not the spell DC) or contract the disease. If the initial target overcomes the disease by making the required number of saving throws, it remains a carrier of the disease for a length of time equal to the disease&rsquo;s frequency, and can continue to infect others during this time.

<i>Erase</i> removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove <i>explosive runes</i>, a <i>glyph of warding</i>, a <i>sepia snake sigil</i>, or an <i>arcane mark</i>, but not <i>illusory script</i> or a <i>symbol</i> spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%. Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase <i>explosive runes</i>, a <i>glyph of warding</i>, or a <i>sepia snake sigil</i>, you accidentally activate that writing instead.

You banish psychic impressions from the object touched, rendering it devoid of recent history. You choose how much time to erase, up to a maximum of 1 day per caster level. You must <i>erase impressions</i> from the present time back; you cannot choose to leave recent events untouched. Impressions erased in this manner cannot be recovered via <i>object reading</i>, <i>legend lore</i>, or similar measures.

Casting <i>erase impressions</i> o n a corpse r emoves recent psychic impressions from when the creature was alive as well, making those memories unavailable to <i>speak with dead</i>. For example, a 5th-level caster casting the spell on a 2-day-old corpse could erase the past 2 days of psychic impressions from the corpse and 3 additional days of information from just before the creature died.

If the initial save was not successful, the target may attempt a new saving throw each round for the duration of the spell or continue to suffer cumulative losses. If the first save fails but a subsequent save succeeds, the eroding effects stop at that point, though any of the penalties already accrued remain until the spell expires. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the target&rsquo;s damage reduction and natural armor bonus immediately return to normal.
</p>

<p>
Only one <i>erode defenses</i> spell can affect a particular target at any one time.

You channel a fraction of the tumultuous ecosystem of the Hao Jin Tapestry and redirect it through your hands as a beam of deteriorating energy. You can fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and can target only a construct or an object. If a ray hits, the target begins to crumble, taking 2d6 points of damage. This damage ignores hardness and damage reduction.

Your skin erupts in swollen, pus-filled bumps that burst open if you are struck. Any creature that strikes you with its body or a hand-held weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of acid damage and must save or be sickened for 1 round. If the attack against you is a critical hit, the attacker must save or be nauseated instead of sickened. This damage can harm a swarm.

You place a ward on an area that notifies you when a creature exits it. This functions as <i><a href="#Alarm">alarm</a></i>, except as noted. It alerts you when a creature leaves, rather than enters, the area, and you can&rsquo;t select a password to bypass its effects. Instead, when you place an <i>escape alarm</i>, you can attune up to one additional creature per caster level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to your own <i>escape alarm</i> and don&rsquo;t count against the limit. Attuned creatures can enter and exit the spell&rsquo;s area without triggering the alarm. If you select a mental alarm rather than an audible one, all attuned creatures receive the mental alert when someone exits the warded area.

This ward grants you extra maneuverability when you avoid attacks against larger foes. While affected by this spell, when you are attacked and missed by a creature that is at least one size category larger than you, you can, as an immediate action, move up to 5 feet away from the attacking creature. You can increase this movement by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

<p>
You place yourself into a cataleptic meditative state and shunt yourself to the Ethereal Plane, where your body is cocooned within a folded ripple of misty space, with total cover from creatures on the Ethereal Plane. While inside your <i>ethereal envelope</i>, you are treated as being asleep for most purposes. You can choose an amount of time within the duration when casting this spell, and you automatically dismiss the spell when that time elapses. Your <i>ethereal envelope</i> counts as an object of your size with AC 10, hardness 5, and hit points equal to twice your level, and it is immune to bludgeoning damage. An attacker must be on the Ethereal Plane or have a way to see ethereal objects in order to detect your <i>ethereal envelope</i>. The envelope can also be broken open with a successful Strength check with a DC equal to 15 + your caster level (to a maximum DC of 30). If the <i>ethereal envelope</i> is destroyed, the spell ends immediately.
</p>

<p>
When the spell ends, you remain asleep without the protection of the envelope for 1 round. At the end of that round, you are shunted back to the Material Plane at the location where you cast the spell, and you are staggered for 1 round as you reorient yourself to the Material Plane. You can&rsquo;t use this spell to travel from your location on the Ethereal Plane. If the space you formerly occupied is now occupied by another creature or object, you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d10 points of damage.

<p>
This spell is similar to <i><a href="#Ethereal Envelope">ethereal envelope</a></i>, but it allows you to shunt an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and seal it there within a cocoon of misty ethereal fibers. If the target fails its save, it&rsquo;s forced into a cataleptic meditative state as if unconscious. However, each round at the end of its turn, it can attempt a Will save to awaken itself from this meditation. Once the target awakens, it is considered pinned, treating your caster level as your CMB and your CMD as 10 + your caster level + your ability modifier for your primary spellcasting ability score. A successful grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check leaves the creature grappled rather than pinned but doesn&rsquo;t allow it to escape. However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the <i>ethereal envelope</i> spell description.
</p>

<p>
If the creature breaks free of the <i>ethereal envelopment</i> or you dismiss the spell, the target is returned to its prior location on the Material Plane, as described for <i>ethereal envelope</i>, but if the target is conscious at the time, it doesn&rsquo;t spend a round asleep or staggered.

You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence.
</p>

<p>
An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
</p>

<p>
Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can&rsquo;t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane.
</p>

<p>
Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material.
</p>

<p>
If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel.

You harden interpenetrated ethereal substance into deadly transdimensional razors that are invisible to normal sight. Movement through an area of <i>etheric shards</i> is halved, even for incorporeal creatures, and creatures entering a 5-foot cube filled with <i>etheric shards</i> take 1d8 points of piercing and slashing damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1 point of bleed damage. This bleed damage stacks with itself and other sources of bleed damage. A creature standing within an area of <i>etheric shards</i> takes no damage as long as it remains completely motionless, but even the minor movements involved in attacking or defending in combat force a stationary creature to attempt a Reflex save. If a stationary creature succeeds at this save, it avoids damage completely for that round, but if it fails, it takes hit point damage and bleed damage as though it had moved through the square.
</p>

<p>
A creature forcibly moved through an area of <i>etheric shards</i>, such as by a bull rush or drag combat maneuver, takes a &minus;4 penalty on its saving throw, but a creature able to see invisible or ethereal objects gains a +4 bonus, and damage to it is completely negated on a successful Reflex save.
</p>

<p>
<i>Etheric shards</i> are considered a magical trap, and a creature with trapfinding can use Perception to find them. The DC of this check is equal to 25 + the spell&rsquo;s level. <i>Etheric shards</i> can&rsquo;t be disabled with the Disable Device skill.

A creature under the effect of this enchantment enters a state of euphoria. The target treats all creatures as dear friends and abhors violence, but may rise up to protect itself if violence is perpetrated against it. Until the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the creature&rsquo;s speed is halved, and it cannot make attacks or cast spells. If the creature is attacked, it gets a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature can make act normally for 1 round. If the saving throw fails, the creature moves half its speed away from the attacker as its next action.

If you successfully identify that the item has magical properties, you can immediately attempt a Spellcraft check to determine the item&rsquo;s properties, as if you had cast <i><a href="#Detect Magic">detect magic</a></i> on the item and examined it for 3 rounds.

You create a low wall or other simple structure of packed earth or loose stone measuring 3 feet thick, 3 feet tall, and 10 feet long per 3 caster levels you possess (minimum 10 feet). Each square of the structure can appear only in unoccupied spaces atop earthen or stone surfaces able to support it.

<p>
At your discretion, you can make the structure half as long but thicker by forming it into a berm consisting of a steep slope on each side. Characters moving uphill (to an adjacent square of higher elevation) must spend 2 squares of movement to enter a square of steep slope. Characters running or charging downhill (moving to an adjacent square of lower elevation) must attempt a DC 10 Acrobatics check upon entering the first steep slope square. Mounted characters attempt a DC 10 Ride check instead. Characters who fail this check stumble and must end their movement 1d2 &times; 5 feet later. Characters who fail by 5 or more fall prone in the square where they end their movement. A steep slope increases the DC of Acrobatics checks by 2.

You can excavate and move earth, dust, and sand up to the size of a 5-foot cube. If you are buried, you may open a 5-foot cube around yourself, but the spell cannot be used for tunneling.
</p>

<p>
Besides its mundane applications, you can open a 5-foot-deep pit at a creature&rsquo;s feet. A Medium or smaller creature falls prone in the pit unless it succeeds on a Reflex save. With a successful save, it can choose to land harmlessly on its feet in the pit or hop to an adjacent square; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature can escape a 5-foot-deep pit with a DC 5 Climb check. Larger creatures may ignore pits smaller than their size.
</p>

<p>
The earth excavated by this spell is ordinarily distributed harmlessly across the spell&rsquo;s range, but you may choose to throw up a burst of grit and debris when you dig a pit. This cloud of debris provides concealment to any creatures in the square affected and all adjacent squares for 1 round. <i>Expeditious excavation</i> has no effect on solid rock or earth creatures.

<p>
You animate a portion of the target&rsquo;s blood, causing it to force itself out of the victim&rsquo;s body and form a corrupted water elemental. The target takes 2d4 points of Constitution damage unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw, blood (or an analogous internal fluid, such as ichor) pours from the target&rsquo;s body and pools in an empty adjacent square of your choice. The fluids immediately form into a fiendish water elemental of the same size as the target (but not larger than a Large fiendish water elemental). This fiendish water elemental does not have the vortex ability, but it has the blood drain special attack, which deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage at the end of the water elemental&rsquo;s turn if it grapples a foe. The elemental gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat. You have no control over the fiendish water elemental once it is summoned, though the water elemental does not attack you under any circumstances.
</p>

<p>
This spell does not affect creatures that are Small or smaller or those that don&rsquo;t have blood or some analogous internal fluid.

You cause all creatures in the affected area to use up one or more of their limited-use magical abilities without any actual effect. A limited-use magical ability is any supernatural or spelllike ability which a creature can only activate a certain number of times during a set interval (3/day, 1/hour, etc.). The spell does not affect abilities which the creature can use at will or which are constant. It also does not apply to magical items or anything else external to a creature. A creature in the spell&rsquo;s area must make a Will saving throw or expend a single use of one of its abilities. Abilities with the greatest number of uses per day are affected first; if more than one ability has the same number of uses, randomly determine which one is affected first. Creatures must continue making Will saves, expending an additional use of an ability for each failed save, until they succeed, at which point the spell has no further effect.

Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of slashing damage from the flying debris.

You call forth a burst of decay that ravages all creatures in the area. Even nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead crumble or wither in this malignant eruption of rotting energy. Creatures in the area of effect take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are staggered for 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and negates the staggered effect. Plant creatures are particularly susceptible to this rotting effect; a plant creature caught in the burst takes a &minus;2 penalty on the saving throw and takes 1 extra point of damage per die.

You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The <i>explosive runes</i> detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the <i>explosive runes</i> (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the <i>explosive runes</i> is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the <i>explosive runes</i> were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).
</p>

<p>
You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the <i>explosive runes</i>. Likewise, you can remove the <i>explosive runes</i> whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>erase</i> spell, but attempting to dispel or <i>erase</i> the <i>explosive runes</i> and failing to do so triggers the explosion.
</p>

<p>
Magic traps such as <i>explosive runes</i> are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart <i>explosive runes</i>. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>explosive runes</i>.

<p>
You conjure up an extradimensional meadow that can be accessed from a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a circle of toadstools enclosing a 10-foot square. Only those you designate can enter the meadow before you do, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You can open it again from your own side at will. Once a visitor has passed through the entry point, they find themselves in an idyllic twilight meadow surrounded by an impassable grove of fruit and nut trees. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
</p>

<p>
You can configure the meadow into any shape you desire, to the limit of the spell&rsquo;s effect. The place is comfortable and temperate. The trees can provide enough food to sustain 4 people per caster level for a day. A staff of near-transparent animal or feylike servants (as many as two per caster level) wait upon all who enter. The servants function as <i><a href="#Unseen Servant">unseen servant</a></i> spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the meadow.
</p>

<p>
Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the meadow, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

This spell functions similarly to <i><a href="#Modify Memory">modify memory</a></i>, except you can modify the target&rsquo;s memory only in a specific way. In response to a triggering condition you determine, up to the last 5 minutes of the target&rsquo;s memory are eliminated and replaced with a memory of your choosing (or no memory at all). For example, you could cast this on an assassin, set it to trigger when he completes his kill, and replace his memory of the murder with the memory of him discovering the body and picking up the murder weapon. You can cast this spell multiple times on the same target, even with the same trigger, affecting different memories. A single casting of <i>false alibi</i> affects a creature only until the specified condition has been triggered; once a condition has been triggered and the target&rsquo;s memory altered, that condition no longer triggers this spell unless the victim is subject to another casting of <i>false alibi</i> that specifies the same trigger.

You temporarily alter the target&rsquo;s memory (similar to <i><a href="#Modify Memory">modify memory</a></i>) to eliminate, change, or implant a memory of up to 1 hour in length. When the duration of this expires, the target&rsquo;s real memory returns, and the false memory fades to little more than a vague outline, like a dream. This false memory seems true to the target, so effects that detect lies or force the target to speak the truth (as the subject understands it) don&rsquo;t detect the falsehood.

You interfere with attempts to predict the target&rsquo;s future by preventing divinations from revealing what the target will do and what will befall the target while under the spell&rsquo;s effects. Instead of the target&rsquo;s true actions or experiences, divinations resolve as if the target will experience some different future you describe as you cast <i>false future</i>. The target creature can attempt a Will save to avoid the initial effect, and creatures using divinations get a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. This spell doesn&rsquo;t prevent divinations cast after the duration&rsquo;s end from determining what the subject actually did during the time you obscured using <i>false future</i>.
</p>

<i>False future</i> can&rsquo;t be detected by <i>detect magic</i> or <i>identify</i>, but <i>greater detect magic</i> can detect it.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Resurrection">resurrection</a></i> except that instead of recalling the dead soul to life, the spell calls a shadow demon with the advanced simple template to possess the body. If you fail to overcome the subject&rsquo;s spell resistance, the subject&rsquo;s soul can negate the calling and gain the option to return to life (as <i>resurrection</i>) in the restored body. The possession otherwise functions (as <i><a href="#Possession">possession</a></i>) except that the subject&rsquo;s soul is not present to resist. When <i>false resurrection</i> ends or the demon is removed from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless (like that created by clone). If the soul hasn&rsquo;t been returned to life already, it has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still lives (as <i>resurrection</i>). If the body was killed, the demon is sent back to the Abyss but the subject remains dead.
</p>

<p>
Attempts to identify <i>false resurrection</i> with a skill check incorrectly identify it as <i>resurrection</i> (see the ruse descriptor on page 192). A fooled viewer mistakes <i>false resurrection</i>&rsquo;s aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.

This functions similarly to <i><a href="#False Vision">false vision</a></i>, but instead of placing the illusion on a nearby area, you can tie it to a specific individual, and can do so from great distances. The spell can be cast at any distance. The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. The target gains the same bonuses and penalties on its Will save to resist this spell as the bonuses and penalties that apply to the <i><a href="#Scrying">scrying</a></i> spell (including a +5 bonus if the target is on another plane).
</p>

<p>
The illusion created by the spell moves with the target, and is not stationary. The image can affect the way the target is perceived, the way the target&rsquo;s surroundings are perceived, and the way that specific creatures or objects around the target are perceived. For the target, and any other specific creatures or objects you specify, you can cause them to appear as other creatures or objects that you designate, not to appear at all, or to have their appearance unaltered. For the target&rsquo;s surroundings, you can choose to make the target appear to be somewhere else, either a specific location with which you are familiar, or a generic location conjured from your imagination. You can change the way that the spell affects the appearance of any of these things by concentrating on the spell. You can also cause creatures or objects to appear in the illusion that are not really there, or to make a creature or object seem to act in a way other than it is actually acting. In this case, you must concentrate on the spell, or these aspects of the illusion simply remain static. The spell can provide visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal sensations as needed.
</p>

<p>
The illusion applies to only those who observe the target via a divination (<i>scrying</i>) spell, and has no effect on viewers who are there in person.

You create an illusory duplicate of your familiar that moves erratically around your familiar&rsquo;s space, frequently moving through the familiar&rsquo;s body with a blurring effect that makes it indistinguishable from the real creature. Attacks against the familiar have a 50% miss chance; attacks that miss instead target the familiar figment, which reacts as if damaged as appropriate to the attack but unlike a <i>mirror image</i> is not destroyed when struck. This spell does not grant your familiar concealment or prevent it from being targeted by spell effects that do not require an attack roll.
</p>

<p>
In addition, as a swift action, your familiar can direct the familiar figment to attempt a melee touch attack, using your base attack bonus and the familiar&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier. If this attack hits, your familiar (but not other creatures) treats that target as flanked until the end of its turn.

<p>
You project your soul into your familiar, taking over its body while leaving its consciousness intact. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.
</p>

<p>
While possessing your familiar, you can communicate with it telepathically. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The familiar&rsquo;s body retains its own Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous twoweapon attacks) than normal. You may use any abilities the familiar has, including spells and spell-like abilities. You cannot speak unless your familiar has the ability to speak a language. You cannot cast spells with somatic components if your familiar does not have anthropomorphic limbs that can perform the appropriate motions.
</p>

<p>
As a standard action, you can return to your body as long as it is within range. If your familiar is slain while your soul is in it and your body is within range, your soul returns to your own body, unharmed. If your familiar is out of range when slain, you die.

You create a larger and far more menacing version of yourself that you can send forth, manipulate like a puppet, and use to interact with others. You can make the duplicate up to two size categories larger than you are and determine a theme as to how it alters your original appearance. However, this duplicate always retains some vestiges of your actual appearance. Creatures who already know you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to disbelieve this spell. Your duplicate has no actual substance, and you cannot use it to alter its surroundings or to attack or otherwise harm creatures it encounters. You can use the duplicate to speak, and interact verbally with creatures using the Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skills, and you gain a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks when using that skill through the duplicate.
</p>

<p>
You can see, hear, taste, and smell your duplicate&rsquo;s surroundings as if you are actually present using your Perception skill. While you also remain aware of your own immediate surroundings when controlling your duplicate, controlling it does take a toll on your senses. You take a &minus;4 penalty on Perception checks while you control your duplicate.
</p>

<p>
The duplicate moves under your mental command, and while you need not act out its movements, you must take a standard action to control your duplicate for 1 round (concentrating on the spell) or it winks out of existence. You can maintain control of your duplicate even if you have no line of sight or line of effect to it.
</p>

<p>
The duplicate immediately winks out of existence if it is hit by an attack or in the area of a damaging effect, or if it moves beyond the maximum range of the spell.

You curse the target with a hunger no food can assuage. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to starve. The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of eating can counter the effect and, further, even attempting to eat causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round unless they make a DC 12 Fortitude save. The target still experiences the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons or potions).

Each round, as a standard action, you can target a single living creature of up to 9 HD and strike it with terrifying waves of power. If the target fails its saving throw, it becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds, and you gain 5 temporary hit points (which disappear after 1 hour). After the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time.

The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. <i>Feather fall</i> instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
</p>

<p>
The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature&rsquo;s maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.
</p>

<i>Feather fall</i> works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

This spell temporarily imbues a potable liquid (including elixirs, extracts, potions, and poisons) with an intoxicant. The caster must succeed at a caster level check in order to affect magic liquids and poisons (DC = 10 + item level for magic liquids, DC equal to the poison&rsquo;s save DC for a poison); otherwise, the spell fails. If the caster succeeds, the liquid also assumes a flavor according to what the caster desires, but the effect on the imbiber is the same.

The target is cursed, gaining the bane of the caster&rsquo;s fey race (see below for details on each specific fey race&rsquo;s bane and duration). A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to further castings of fey blight from the same type of fey for 24 hours. Fey blight cannot be dispelled, but effects that remove curses function against it.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Atomie
	<td>	Atomies liberally use their bane in order to gain an edge in their duels or to hinder attackers. Fortunately for their targets, the curse is as short-lived as the atomie&rsquo;s attention span.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: You treat any weapon you wield as though it were sized for a wielder one size category smaller than you. This reduces the weapon&rsquo;s damage die type appropriately and causes you to take a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls. The weapon&rsquo;s actual size and amount of effort required to use it (light, one-handed, or two-handed) do not change. This bane has a duration of 24 hours.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Dryad
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	The fastest way to rouse a dryad&rsquo;s anger is to threaten her tree or the trees of her forest (although some dryads permit limited woodcutting of nearby trees, if performed respectfully), yet the good-hearted fey rarely curse those who are not obviously malicious. On occasion, those transformed into trees by the dryad&rsquo;s bane are reborn as dryads themselves; such fey combine most of their former skills with a dryad&rsquo;s heart, making them fierce protectors of their tree&rsquo;s domain.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: You take 1d2 points of Dexterity drain each morning as your flesh slowly transforms into wood. If this bane is removed, all Dexterity drain you have accumulated from this bane immediately disappears. If this bane reduces your Dexterity score to 0, you transform into a full-grown, mundane oak tree, taking root in your present location and potentially damaging structures or floors in the process. This bane is permanent.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Huldra
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	The easiest way to anger a huldra is to draw attention to her tail or mention her race&rsquo;s rumored links to trollkind&mdash;most huldras consider their bane perfect for punishing such impropriety. Huldras are capricious, however, and a heartfelt apology might persuade a huldra to undo her fey curse. A huldra resents attempts made to constrain her travels, and may bestow her bane upon any who impinge upon her inviolable right to wander the land. Huldras rarely curse foes during combat, save as a final act of vengeance when the battle is lost.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: Your body warps into a troll-like appearance, becoming rangy, potbellied, and profoundly ugly. At the same time, your personality becomes oafish and dull. Your Charisma score is reduced by an amount equal to the bane&rsquo;s caster level (to a minimum of 6). This bane is permanent.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Lampad
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	A lampad does not hesitate to use her bane in combat against those undeterred by her insane beauty or supernatural weeping. Those who flagrantly disrespect the cave-maid or her home might suffer her curse as well. Lampads rarely inflict their bane upon otherwiseinnocent miners or adventurers, but the fickle fey have little patience for those who insist on outstaying their welcome. When a lampad has acted hastily in cursing an interloper due to some misunderstanding, she can be convinced to revoke her bane, although respect and diplomacy are key.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: You constantly weep streams of thick tears, impairing your vision. You treat all other creatures as if they had concealment, and spells you cast that require line of sight have a 20% spell failure chance. This bane is permanent.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Leprechaun
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Much like atomies, leprechauns make liberal use of their bane to embarrass or frustrate their targets. A leprechaun might even offer a &ldquo;solution&rdquo;to remove the curse it inflicted, usually something embarrassing, such as bathing naked in the town fountain at noon. Of course, the supposed solution does nothing about the curse unless the leprechaun is sufficiently amused to remove it.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: Your mundane possessions crumble in times of stress or need. Whenever you roll initiative, you must succeed at a Fortitude save (with a DC equal to the DC of the fey blight spell-like ability) or one of your nonmagical possessions degrades, gaining the broken condition. A broken item affected this way is destroyed. The affected item is chosen by the GM, but the curse tends to affect items that are particularly precious to the victim. All mundane clothing is considered to be a single item for this bane, as are all carried coins. This bane has a duration of 1 week.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Nereid
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	A nereid often uses her bane to complement her beguiling aura, especially against lone foes. The nereid may also curse creatures on a whim, delighting in stupefied fools obeying everything they hear. In cases where an nereid&rsquo;s shawl has fallen into enemy hands, she may attempt to surreptitiously curse whoever has it, hoping to force him to return the precious item.  While some thieves have stolen a nereid&rsquo;s shawl in hopes of demanding her boon, the cunning fey usually inflicts her bane upon the thief as soon as her shawl is safely back in her possession.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: Whenever someone speaks to you, you must succeed at a Will save (with a DC equal to the DC of the fey blight spell-like ability) or treat their words as a suggestion (as per the spell). This effect only applies if the words could logically be obeyed, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion. This bane is permanent.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Norn
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	A norn&rsquo;s bane is employed in service of her enigmatic goals. A norn might linger on the edge of a great and portentous battle, imparting her bane to those whose death is decreed by fate, or cursing a leader to ensure that an assassin&rsquo;s blade finds its mark.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: The norn exposes the thread of your fate for others to cut. Melee and ranged attacks against you have their critical threat ranges and multipliers increased to 16&ndash;20/&times;3. In addition, you take a &minus;5 penalty on saving throws against spells. This bane is permanent and much more tenacious than most curses; it can be removed by only a miracle or wish spell, or by the norn herself.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Nymph
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Nymphs are easily angered, and consider their bane to be yet another tool for punishing interlopers. A nymph most often inflicts her bane upon those who rudely disrespect her beauty. Nymphs can inadvertently curse their lovers in the throes of passion without realizing that they have done so, leading to rumors that sharing a nymph&rsquo;s bed brings madness.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: You are haunted by the nymph&rsquo;s loveliness, before which all other beauty is dross. You no longer benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances. In addition, memories of the nymph&rsquo;s beauty slowly drive you mad. Once per month, you must succeed at a Will save (with a DC equal to the DC of the fey blight spell-like ability) or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. This bane is permanent.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Oceanid
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Despite their quick tempers, oceanids save their bane only for those who particularly displease them. Directly insulting the oceanid, polluting her home, or refusing to acknowledge her dominion over her realm might provoke an oceanid to inflict her curse. Oceanids travel far and communicate often with sea creatures; a vengeful oceanid might easily track down despoilers and butchers that believe themselves too distant for retribution. Oceanids prefer to curse bards, sea captains, spellcasters, and others who rely on their voices.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: Your body becomes extremely withered and dehydrated, and no amount of water can restore you. You are exhausted and cannot recover from the exhausted condition while this curse is in effect. In addition, your dry tongue and cracked lips impose a 20% spell failure chance on any spell with verbal components that you attempt to cast. This bane is permanent.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Quickling
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Given the long-term nature of the quickling&rsquo;s bane, the sadistic fey save it for those targets they do not immediately kill, allowing them to savor the torment they inflict. They are quite fond of cursing children, stealing their youth and thrusting them into adulthood. A quickling with no chance of escape might spitefully curse a foe, relying on the bane to punish its killer even after its death. Under almost no circumstances will a quickling revoke its bane, even under threat of death&mdash;the hateful creatures would rather die than undo the suffering they&rsquo;ve caused.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: The quickling&rsquo;s bane accelerates your body&rsquo;s aging, causing you to physically age 1 year for every week that passes. Although your physical ability scores are reduced as normal for your body&rsquo;s age, your mental ability scores do not improve. This bane is permanent; even if removed, any aging that occurred while this bane was in effect can be undone by only greater restoration, miracle, or wish.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Satyr
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Although satyrs are famously ardent in their attempts to persuade others to join their revelry, the vast majority of satyrs will respect refusal&mdash;although they are hardly shy about their disappointment. However, merely rejecting a satyr&rsquo;s advances is usually insufficient to earn his bane; a satyr instead inflicts his bane on those who are particularly cruel or prideful in how they reject his advances or company. In addition, threatening a female fey provokes the wrath of any satyr who learns of such deeds.

<p>
<b>Bane</b>: Your mindset becomes coarse and brutish, and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are reduced by 2 each (to a minimum of 3). In addition, whenever presented with the opportunity to indulge in hedonistic pleasures such as revelry, food and drink, or sexual pleasure, you must succeed at a Will save (with a DC equal to the DC of the fey blight spell-like ability) or be compelled to ecstatically indulge yourself to the fullest. This bane is permanent.

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Atomie
	<td>	Among the smallest fey, atomies are nevertheless obsessed with martial deeds. They often follow adventuring parties traveling through their lands, listening in on campfire tales and occasionally challenging proud warriors to duels. A warrior who claims victory with honor (while enduring the little fey&rsquo;s attempts to even the odds) might earn the atomie&rsquo;s boon. In other cases, a storyteller who enraptures the atomie with tales of glory might be granted this gift, especially if she strokes the little warrior&rsquo;s ego in the process.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: You treat any weapon you wield as though it were masterwork, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls. If you wield a weapon that is already masterwork, you instead gain a +1 enhancement bonus on damage rolls. This boon has a duration of 1 hour per caster level (6 hours for a typical atomie).
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Dryad
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	When a dryad&rsquo;s tree comes under threat from lumberhungry settlements or bands of evil humanoids, the treebound fey might seek aid from kindly heroes. A dryad might offer her boon as an incentive, as it allows these protectors to retreat to her side to regroup if necessary. Even when no threat is present, a dryad might become infatuated with a comely humanoid who stumbles upon her isolated grove, granting her boon to her lover so that they can reunite with ease.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: You gain the druid&rsquo;s woodland stride ability. If you already have that ability, you instead move normally through magically manipulated terrain effects and gain a +10-foot bonus to your land speed while in forest terrain. This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (6 days for a typical dryad). You can step into any tree with a girth at least equal to yours and transport yourself to the dryad&rsquo;s tree, as per tree stride, but doing so immediately ends the boon&rsquo;s effects.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Huldra
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Fox-tailed huldras are wild and impulsive, but their boon is not lightly granted. Aiding a huldra against hostile foes might earn her favor, but opportunities to do so are uncommon; the deceptively strong fey are no damsels in distress. An amorous huldra might offer her boon to her lover while her passions are high, but woe betide the paramour who behaves as though entitled to her gifts. More thoughtful huldras, aware of the transformation their boon causes and their own shyness regarding their tails, consult with potential recipients before granting a boon; most, though, grant it without a second thought.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: You grow a foxlike tail like that which a huldra has. This tail is infused with supernatural strength and you can use it as a primary natural weapon that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (1d4 for a Small creature). This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (4 days for a typical huldra).
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Lampad
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Due to their sullen, moody demeanors and their general perception of surface races as greed-driven strip miners, lampads rarely grant their gifts to others. A lampad&rsquo;s boon is most often granted to those miners who graciously ask the cave-maid&rsquo;s permission to mine the earth, and who further promise to honor the stone by leaving carvings and artful designs in exchange for its bounty of jewels and metal. Additionally, those who defend the sanctity of the lampad&rsquo;s caves might earn her boon. In any case, though, demanding a reward from the lampad elicits only a sulky refusal.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet and the dwarf &rsquo;s stonecunning racial trait. In addition, when you&rsquo;re underground in unworked caverns, the stone around you speaks to you, warning you of danger and granting you a +1 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saving throws. This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (7 days for a typical lampad).

A leprechaun who crosses paths with a fellow trickster may grant his boon, hoping to spread mischief without having to do the legwork or put his own neck on the line. In such cases, the leprechaun often follows the boon&rsquo;s recipient invisibly for a time, hoping for a demonstration of tomfoolery; failure to provide a good show might force the leprechaun to make his own fun at the recipient&rsquo;s expense. While rumor suggests that capturing a leprechaun might earn its boon, the fey is more likely to secretly curse his captor instead.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: The First World&rsquo;s illusions are at your command. You can use the following spell-like abilities three times each: dancing lights, disguise self, ghost sound, major image (visual and auditory elements only), and ventriloquism. Their caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. This boon lasts until you have expended all the spell-like abilities or after 1 week, whichever is sooner.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Nereid
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Sailors and other seafarers prize the favor of a nereid, though nereids are unpredictable creatures and what earns a specific nereid&rsquo;s boon may vary wildly. A lustful nereid might grant her boon to attractive humanoids, encouraging them to keep her company in her watery home. Such lovers must be careful not to anger their fey host, or risk being stripped of this gift at an inopportune time. Performing a great service for the nereid, such as reclaiming her stolen shawl, is likely to earn her favor. 

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: You grow gills, allowing you to breathe water as well as air. This boon is permanent.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Norn
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Norns are among the most powerful fey creatures, with potent knowledge of the future and supernatural control over the fate of mortals. As norns are able to peer into futures yet unwoven, the actions to earn their gifts can seem incomprehensible to all but the norns themselves. On rare occasions, a norn appears before heroes or adventurers&mdash;even those that may be lacking in experience or power&mdash;and imparts her boon; often, the recipients then become enmeshed in worldshaking events, driven by the supernatural foresight of the fey gift.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC and on saving throws. In addition, you occasionally (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion) gain cryptic flashes of insight into the future, or even visions of events to come. This boon has a duration of 9 months.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Nymph
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	While not bound to locations as literally as dryads, nymphs protect their pure and unspoiled homes to the end. Heroes who defend the nymph&rsquo;s abode&mdash;or any other site of natural beauty&mdash;might earn the nymph&rsquo;s boon. Additionally, nymphs are more willing to interact with mortals than most other fey, and those who perform a great service for a region&rsquo;s reclusive fey might receive a nymph&rsquo;s boon. This boon always enhances the recipient&rsquo;s physical attractiveness in such a way that reflects the nymph&rsquo;s own appearance, such as changes to match the nymph&rsquo;s skin or hair color, enlarged or almondshaped eyes, or pointed ears. This manifestation might be due to the nymph&rsquo;s infusion of her own essence into the recipient, or might simply reflect the fey maiden&rsquo;s intense narcissism.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: Your appearance changes to become more physically attractive for your race and gender; this change always causes you to partly resemble the nymph who granted it. In addition, you are beloved by nature itself; animals and plants have a starting attitude of friendly toward you, and such creatures never attack you unless provoked, compelled, or directed by a bonded master (such as a druid directing her animal companion). This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (8 days for a typical nymph), although the enhancements to the recipient&rsquo;s appearance are usually permanent.
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Oceanid
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Vain and unpredictable, oceanids grant their boon most often to those seafarers who honor them as the beautiful queens of the sea that they believe themselves to be. Heroes who dispatch mighty threats to the oceanid&rsquo;s realm, such as aboleths or scrag tribes, might also earn the fey&rsquo;s gift. What is granted can be revoked, however, and the wise recipient remains respectful to the ocean queen lest the fickle oceanid remove her favor.


<p>
<b>Boon</b>: You can summon a shroud of the oceanid&rsquo;s water to protect and serve you. You gain the kineticist&rsquo;s basic hydrokinesis wild talent and shroud of water defense wild talent, as a kineticist with a level equal to your Hit Dice. You cannot accept burn when using these talents unless you have the burn class feature. If you are a hydrokineticist, you instead gain a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls with water-based kinetic blasts. This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (9 days for a typical oceanid).
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Quickling
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	Among the cruelest fey, quicklings rarely grant their boon. The primary exceptions are when coerced by a greater force, such as a more powerful fey or one of Irrisen&rsquo;s winter witches, or when they find someone as bitter and wicked as themselves. A quickling might grant its boon under direct duress, but is more likely to attempt to curse its captor instead. When a quickling grants a boon, the treacherous creature revokes it at the earliest opportunity.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: The quickling&rsquo;s boon lets you muster bursts of incredible speed. Once per minute as a swift action, you can gain the benefits of haste for 1 round. This boon has a duration of 1 hour per caster level (6 hours for a typical quickling).
<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Satyr
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	The easiest way to court a satyr&rsquo;s favor is to join in his revels, whether wild hedonism or open-minded enjoyment of new experiences. A satyr most often grants his boon to those who entertain the satyr in novel and exciting ways, whether by talented artistic performances, bold tales, or&mdash;of course&mdash;lusty demonstrations. Satyrs love freedom for themselves and others and might grant their boon to champions of liberty.

<p>
<b>Boon</b>: You take on physical characteristics that the satyr believes will make you more attractive (whether or not his aesthetic preferences match your own). If you are male, you become tall and ruggedly handsome, with a sculpted physique; if you are female, you become beautiful and curvaceous, with long, luxurious hair; if you are agender or nonbinary, you become slender and androgynously beautiful. In addition, you gain powerful sexual magnetism, granting you a +4 enhancement bonus on all Charisma-based skill and ability checks against creatures that could be sexually attracted to you. This boon lasts for 1 day per caster level (8 days for a typical satyr).

You assume the form of a Small or Medium creature of the fey type. Your base speed changes to match the new form&rsquo;s base speed, with a maximum speed of 60 feet (even if the chosen fey form has a base speed in excess of that speed). If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain those abilities: climb speed 30 feet, fly speed 30 feet (average maneuverability), swim speed 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, and boot stomp.

This spell functions as the planar travel function of <i><a href="#Gate">gate</a></i>, except it can be used to travel only between points on the Material Plane and the First World, and it comes with additional dangers.
</p>

<p>
This spell forms a circular portal between 5 and 20 feet in diameter (your choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into being (typically vertical and facing you). The portal is full of gray fog that blocks line of sight.
</p>

<p>
Anyone or anything that moves through the portal to enter the First World is shunted instantly to a random point on that plane (the same point for everything traveling via a particular casting). At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the caster can attempt a DC 30 Spellcraft check. On a success, the portal remains open for 1d4+1 days. Creatures exiting the First World through a fey <i>gate</i> always arrive at the location the spell was cast.
</p>

<p>
While the spell always deposits travelers on solid ground in the First World, it conveys no protections against whatever creatures or environmental hazards may be present there.

You create a mobile cylinder of wind encompassing every target of the spell and protecting them as <i><a href="#Wind Wall">wind wall</a></i>, but not interfering with them in any way.

This spell transforms your body into living flame. You and your equipment are immune to fire damage. In fact, every time you would normally take damage from fire, you are instead healed of damage at a rate of 1 point per 3 points of damage the fire attack would have normally inflicted. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells that affect your physiology or respiration. You take only half damage from acid or electricity. You take 150% as much damage from cold than normal.
</p>

<p>
You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score and a fly speed of 40&rsquo; (perfect maneuverability). Your unarmed attack deals an additional 3d6 points of fire damage, and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your body burns so brightly that creatures who do not avert their gaze from you are dazzled. Fire spells you cast have their save DCs increased by +1. If you enter water, you are surrounded by a 5-foot radius of steam and bubbles that grant you concealment (50% miss chance) but you take 2d6 points of damage each round you remain in water.

You charge a weapon with a magic rune of fire. When the wielder of the weapon successfully strikes a foe in melee with the weapon, the wielder can discharge the rune as a swift action to deal 1d4+1 points of fire damage to the target. This damage isn&rsquo;t multiplied on a critical hit. If the target has spell resistance, you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance when the rune is discharged. If the rune is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled; otherwise, the rune deals damage normally.
</p>

<p>
For every 2 caster levels beyond 3rd the caster possesses, the rune deals an additional 1d4+1 points of fire damage (2d4+2 at caster level 5th, 3d4+3 at 7th, and so on) to a maximum of 5d4+5 points of fire damage at caster level 11th.

Any shuriken you do not launch as part of casting this spell remains floating near you for the spell&rsquo;s duration.

You disrupt the conjuring energies within a summoned creature, causing it to violently explode.

This damage is fire damage unless the target creature has the cold or water subtype, in which case it&rsquo;s cold damage. Creatures caught in this explosion take half damage if they succeed at their Reflex saves against this spell&rsquo;s DC. <i>Final sacrifice</i> can detonate a summoner&rsquo;s eidolon, though an eidolon receives a +4 bonus on its Fortitude save unless the spell is cast by the eidolon&rsquo;s own summoner.

Additionally, your first melee or ranged attack roll against the creature before the end of your next turn gains a +5 insight bonus. If the creature is polymorphed, disguised, or hidden by an illusion and you are not aware of it&rsquo;s true form, this spell fails as if the target has spell resistance you failed to penetrate (the GM may have you attempt a caster level check to conceal the true reason for the spell&rsquo;s failure).

You sense whether a well-known creature you can clearly visualize is within a 20-mile radius of your current location, as well as the distance and direction to the creature in relation to you. You also discern whether the creature is moving, and its direction, speed, and mode of movement. The radius you can sense increases by 5 miles for every two caster levels you have above 10th (to a maximum of a 45-mile radius at 20th level). Anything that would prevent <i><a href="#Locate Creature">locate creature</a></i> from finding a creature also prevents <i>find quarry</i> from doing so.

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a prominent specified destination, such as a city, keep, lake, or dungeon. The locale can be outdoors or underground, as long as it is prominent. For example, a hunter&rsquo;s cabin is not prominent enough, but a logging camp is. <i>Find the path</i> works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as the subject at the time of casting.
</p>

<p>
The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense what cavern corridor to take when a choice presents itself. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. <i>Find the path</i> can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a <i>maze</i> spell in a single round, specifying the destination as &ldquo;outside the <i>maze</i>.&rdquo; This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians) who might take action to oppose the caster as he follows the path revealed by this spell.

You transform the target&rsquo;s fins, flippers, or tail into legs and feet, allowing it to walk on land. The target loses its swim speed but gains a base speed appropriate for a humanoid of its size (speed 30 if a Medium or larger creature, speed 20 if Small). If the creature is immersed in water for 1 round, the transformation reverts, allowing it to swim normally. One round after leaving the water, the transformation occurs again, allowing it to walk.

This spell only works on merfolk, tritons, seals, fish, and other creatures whose bodies or limbs are used mainly for swimming and are not suitable for walking. It does not give the target the ability to breathe air.

When you cast this spell, flammable liquid oozes from your pores, dripping onto the ground and spontaneously combusting. The flame does not harm you. During this spell&rsquo;s duration, each time you leave your space, you create a trail of fire that burns within the spaces you move through for 1 round before it burns out. You can leave up to 60 feet of flame trail each round, assuming you are Small or Medium. If you are larger than Medium, the maximum trail length is reduced based on your size. If you are Large, you can leave a trail up to 30 feet long (and 10 feet wide), and if you are Huge, you can leave a trail up to 15 feet long (and 15 feet wide); even larger casters can only leave a trail up to 10 feet long (and as wide as your space) each round. You choose where to leave a flame trail.
</p>

<p>
Creatures that start their turn adjacent to the flame trail take 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that start their turn within the flame trail or that enter an area of flame take a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10). If a creature moves into an area of the flame trail multiple times in a round, it takes this damage each time it enters the area of the flame trail. Flammable objects in or adjacent to the fire trail catch fire.

<i>Fire trap</i> creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A <i>fire trap</i> spell can ward any object that can be opened and closed.
</p>

<p>
When casting <i>fire trap</i>, you select a point on the object as the spell&rsquo;s center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell&rsquo;s center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
</p>

<p>
A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A <i>knock</i> spell does not bypass a <i>fire trap</i>. An unsuccessful <i>dispel magic</i> spell does not detonate the spell.
</p>

<p>
Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
</p>

<p>
You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.
</p>

<p>
Magic traps such as <i>fire trap</i> are hard to detect and disable. A character with trapfinding can use the Perception skill to find a <i>fire trap</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid&rsquo;s <i>fire trap</i> or DC 29 for the arcane version).

A <i>fireball</i> spell generates a searing explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area.
</p>

<p>
Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
</p>

<p>
You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the <i>fireball</i> is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the <i>fireball</i> at that point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must &ldquo;hit&rdquo; the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The <i>fireball</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the <i>fireball</i> may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

A magical fire warms your belly, granting fire resistance 5 and making your gut hot to the touch (but not enough to damage you or anything else). As a standard action, you can breathe a 15-foot cone of flame that deals 1d4 points of fire damage (Reflex half, SR applies).

You mark several allies with a flaming rune. This rune does not cause damage, and sheds light as if it were a torch. While the <i>firebrand</i> burns, any creature it marks is immune to damage from any fire spell you cast. All of the target&rsquo;s weapons (both natural and manufactured) inflict +1d6 points of fire damage on a hit (this bonus fire damage stacks with any amount of fire damage a creature&rsquo;s weapons might already inflict). At any point during the spell&rsquo;s duration, a creature bearing a <i>firebrand</i> can launch a beam of fire at any target within 30 feet as a swift action. This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 6d6 points of fire damage. Once a creature uses its <i>firebrand</i> to fire a ray in this manner, the effects of the spell end for that creature.

<i>Firefall</i> causes a fire to erupt into a geyser of dazzlingly bright liquid flame. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire larger than a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, but a creature of the fire subtype used as the source takes 1 point of damage per caster level (no saving throw).
</p>

<p>
The coruscating rain of fire fills a hemispherical burst with a radius of 60 feet. All creatures and objects in the area take 5d6 points of fire damage and catch on fire.
</p>

<p>
Creatures who make successful Reflex saves take half damage and don&rsquo;t catch on fire. Creatures within 120 feet of the original fire source are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).

<p>
You focus your mind on blocking out pain, allowing your body to endure punishments that would be otherwise unbearable. While under the effects of this spell, you continue to register pain&mdash;you simply don&rsquo;t suffer the deleterious effects such sensations bring. For example, if you were lit on fire as you slept, you would still wake from the pain of burning even though some of the fire damage you endured (perhaps all of it) would be negated by this spell.
</p>

<p>
You gain DR 5/magic, resist fire 10, and a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist pain effects. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged. At any time during the spell&rsquo;s duration when you take damage that would be subject to the damage reduction or energy resistance granted by this spell, you can expend the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration as an immediate action in order to increase the effects to DR 10/magic, resist fire 30, and immunity to pain effects. If you do so, these enhanced effects persist for 3 rounds. After this time, the spell ends.

The alignment and personality of the wayang are not affected by the transformation, but the spell conceals her alignment as per <i><a href="#Undetectable Alignment">undetectable alignment</a></i>. Unlike <i>ancestral</i> regression, this spell grants the target a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as a gnome; even though the wayang appears as a gnomish analog of herself, the differences between gnomes and wayangs are great enough that she cannot be mistaken for a gnome by other wayangs who know her.

The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A <i>flame blade</i> can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

The spell allows you channel fire into your very being. If you don&rsquo;t already have the fire subtype, this spell grants you the fire subtype. If you already have the fire subtype, you instead channel the flames from your being outward, creating a 10-foot-radius aura of fire centered on you. Creatures who enter or end their turns in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d8 points of fire damage.

A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A <i>flaming sphere</i> rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.
</p>

<p>
The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A <i>flaming sphere</i> winks out if it exceeds the spell&rsquo;s range.

You cause flames to spring up in the area of effect. These flames deal 1d6 points of fire damage for every 3 caster levels you have (maximum 5d6) to each creature that enters a burning area or begins its turn in the area; these creatures also catch on fire. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save negates the damage and avoids catching on fire. The area and all adjacent 5-foot squares are smoky, providing concealment within. You can concentrate as a standard action to ignite one 5-foot square adjacent to a currently burning square. Heavy precipitation (including <i>sleet storm</i>) ends the spell. Strong and severe winds spread each square of <i>flashfire</i> downwind by one square each round, but windstorm-force or stronger winds extinguish the fires.

<p>
You cause a single object to temporarily gain the broken condition. The target must be a single solid object, regardless of its composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Attended objects are allowed a Fortitude save. When this spell ends, the object reverts to its original quality. An item destroyed while under the effects of this spell remains destroyed when this spell ends.

<p>
This spell can be cast on a single construct to disrupt its animating force. A construct that fails its saving throw takes a &minus;2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for the duration of the spell.

You create a gap in the target&rsquo;s memory, preventing the target from remembering anything that happens from the moment you cast this spell until the moment its complete duration ends. <i>Fleeting memory</i> doesn&rsquo;t wipe out its target&rsquo;s memories until the end of its duration, so the target can remember the preceding rounds until the spell&rsquo;s duration ends. If the spell ends prematurely, either because you dismiss it or because it is dispelled, it disperses without affecting its target&rsquo;s memory.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not the target&rsquo;s save is successful, the target forgets that you cast a spell.

<p>
You animate one corpse that has been dead no more than 48 hours. It rises as a zombie that is magically tethered to you and obeys your commands. As noted in <i><a href="#Animate Dead">animate dead</a></i>, you can&rsquo;t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.
</p>

<p>
This spell disguises the zombie&rsquo;s appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie&rsquo;s outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie&rsquo;s normal staggered condition doesn&rsquo;t apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the <i>flesh puppet</i> as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.
</p>

<p>
An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can&rsquo;t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.
</p>

<p>
The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won&rsquo;t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.
</p>

<p>
When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse. The spell ends automatically if you cast <i>flesh puppet</i> or <i>flesh puppet</i> horde on a new corpse.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Flesh Puppet">flesh puppet</a></i>, but can animate multiple zombies. As noted in <i><a href="#Animate Death">animate dead</a></i>, you can&rsquo;t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level. A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie&rsquo;s string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn&rsquo;t end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a <i>flesh puppet</i> requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per round.
</p>

<p>
Unlike with <i>flesh puppet</i>, you can command a zombie to attack. If you do, all your zombies immediately gain the staggered quality and no longer appear to be alive.

This functions like <i><a href="#Baleful Polymorph">baleful polymorph</a></i>, except the target becomes an ooze. A creature of 3 HD or less becomes a gray ooze, 4&ndash;9 HD becomes a gelatinous cube or ochre jelly, and 10+ HD becomes a black pudding. Alternatively, instead of a creature you may target a quantity of inert flesh (such as that created by the <i>stone to flesh</i> spell) of sufficient mass, which becomes an ooze of your choice.
</p>

<p>
Because a target&rsquo;s gear does not transform with it, any items fall under or within the ooze&rsquo;s body, which may mean the items are destroyed. If the ooze has the split ability, splitting the ooze creates one ooze that retains the creature&rsquo;s original identity (for the purpose of memories or restoring the creature) and one normal mindless ooze of that type.

<p>
You animate corpses, forming them into a wall of joined flesh and limbs. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall can&rsquo;t be created so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must be vertical, but can be shaped as you see fit.
</p>

<p>
The wall is considered to be undead. It uses your Will saving throw to resist channel energy.
</p>

<p>
A <i>flesh wall</i> is 2 feet thick. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 12 hit points and DR 5/slashing. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. As a move action, you can cause the fleshwall to constrict, shrinking it by a 5-foot square to fill the hole. Additionally, as a standard action, you can cause a 5-foot square of the wall to permanently detach, forming a human zombie under your verbal control (this zombie doesn&rsquo;t count against your normal limit of commanded undead). The zombie reverts back into a normal corpse when the spell&rsquo;s effect ends. Each 5-foot square of the wall makes a single slam attack against an adjacent enemy on your turn, as a human zombie. The squares of the wall threaten their adjacent squares and can even provide flanking.
</p>

<p>
Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. The DC to move through the wall is equal to 15 + your caster level. A creature that fails the check is trapped in the wall, takes 3d6 points of crushing damage, and is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the wall&rsquo;s slam attack. The creature can make an attempt to escape the wall on its next turn.
</p>

<p>
You can use zombies already under your control as the material components for a <i>flesh wall</i>. However, they and any other corpses in the wall revert back to inanimate corpses when the spell ends.

If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. <i>Fleshworm infestation</i> cannot be ended early by <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i>, as the infestation starts anew if the current worms are slain. <i>Protection from evil</i> negates this spell&rsquo;s effects for as long as the two durations overlap.

<p>
The target&rsquo;s flesh fills out and gains a healthy, natural color. This gives the target the appearance of a living creature of the type it was when it was still alive (if applicable). Creatures casting spells such as <i>detect undead</i> must succeed at a saving throw (with a DC equal to the spell&rsquo;s save DC) to detect the target&rsquo;s presence, and if the target is intelligent, it gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear alive or recently deceased. If the undead has any features different from those of the type of living creature it most resembles (such as a ghoul&rsquo;s elongated teeth and claws), those features shrink and become less prominent, and the subject deals damage as though it were one size smaller. This spell has no effect on creatures that are skeletal or otherwise lack flesh.

You curse your target with a withering aura that degrades its armor and shield (if any). This reduces the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus of any armor or shield worn by the target by 1. For every hour the target wears a suit of armor or a shield, the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus are reduced by an additional 1. If the armor or shield&rsquo;s hardness is reduced to 0, anytime the target of the curse is struck while wearing that item, there is a 20% chance that it gains the broken condition. If the enhancement bonus of magic suit of armor or shield is reduced to 0, the armor or shield loses any other special abilities it had.
</p>

<p>
If the target removes the suit of armor or shield (even if it&rsquo;s broken or has been drained of all enhancement bonuses), the armor or shield regains its hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus at the rate of 1 per 2 hours. A suit of armor or shield broken by this curse that regains its full hardness ceases to be broken. A magic suit of armor or shield that lost its special abilities regains them when its enhancement bonus is fully restored.

Finally, you can move through water with a swim speed of 60 feet and can breathe both water and air for the duration of this effect. You are treated as if you had the water subtype while this spell is in effect.

The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load).
</p>

<p>
It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a <i>fly</i> spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a <i>fly</i> spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to &frac12; your caster level.
</p>

<p>
Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the <i>fly</i> spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an <i>antimagic field</i>.

You can temporarily make copper or silver seem to be an equivalent amount of gold. The spell affects 1 gp/level worth of material (thus, at 3rd level, the spell affects up to 300 copper pieces, 30 silver pieces, or a copper or silver item worth no more than 3 gp). Coins increase in value as normal for the new type of coinage. For items other than coins, some of the value of the item comes from its craftsmanship, regardless of the metal used, so the value of the item seems to be 5 times (for silver items) or 50 times (for copper items) its true value. Thus, a copper candlestick originally worth 5 cp transformed by this spell appears to be worth 250 cp, or 2 gp and 5 sp. A successful DC 25 Appraise check automatically detects the true nature of the coins or items. Creatures inspecting or interacting with the coins or items can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.

You can affect one additional Medium or smaller creature or its equivalent per 3 caster levels (a Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth).

In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours; see below.

You conjure an anchor of pure force that immediately skewers your target on a successful ranged touch attack. If it hits, the attack deals the target 1d4 points of force damage per 2 caster levels (max 5d4) and the anchor becomes firmly lodged in the target&rsquo;s torso.
</p>

<p>
The anchor has no weight, but its wide flukes prevent the target from moving through any space smaller than the creature&rsquo;s size. The anchor also prevents incorporeal targets from moving through solid objects.

<p>
You create a hook of force that strikes the target and drags you to a space adjacent to it. Make a ranged touch attack against the target; if the touch attack succeeds, the target takes 1 point of force damage per caster level. Whether or not the touch attack hits, the force hook drags you in a straight line to a square adjacent to the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The pulling hook keeps you from falling as part of this movement; therefore you can use it to cross a pit or chasm, or reach a higher or lower elevation. If the line of effect from you to the target passes through an area that is too small to fit your body (such as a portcullis or arrow slit), the hook pulls you to that location and you take damage as if you had fallen the distance from your starting point to that location. If you are restrained, such as being chained to a wall, the hook pulls you to the maximum extent of your restraints but does not break the restraints.
</p>

<p>
If your travel to the destination is not blocked, you land on your feet, unharmed by the sudden motion. However, the spell does not guarantee you a safe landing space when you arrive. For example, if your target is flying or on a ledge with no room for you to stand, once the hook pulls you adjacent to the target, you begin to fall.
</p>

<p>
If you use this spell with your spell combat class ability, you can make your melee attack from your starting position or your ending position.

This spell charges your hand with telekinetic force. Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d4 points of force damage per level (maximum 10d4) and causes the target to be pushed away from you in a straight line up to 5 feet per two caster levels. For every size category of the target above Medium, reduce the distance pushed by 5 feet (&minus;5 feet for Large, &minus;10 feet for Huge, &minus;15 for Gargantuan, and &minus;20 feet for Colossal) to a minimum of 0 feet.

This spell creates an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice).
</p>

<p>
Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails.
</p>

<p>
Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
</p>

<p>
Like a <i>wall of force</i>, a <i>forcecage</i> resists <i>dispel magic</i>, although a mage&rsquo;s disjunction still functions. The walls of a <i>forcecage</i> can be damaged by spells as normal, except for <i>disintegrate</i>, which automatically destroys it. The walls of a <i>forcecage</i> can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but they have a Hardness of 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> or <i>rod of cancellation</i> instantly destroys a <i>forcecage</i>.

You can&rsquo;t attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.

The body of the target creature twists and distorts, reshaping into a grotesque figure. Because of the disfigurement, the creature takes a &minus;4 penalty to Constitution and Charisma. The creature also receives one of the following deformities (your choice) from the list in the mutant acquired template: blind, deaf, fragile, fractured mind, lame, poor ability (applied to your choice of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Wisdom), spasms, and useless arm. The deformity is subject to all limitations described in the mutant template (for example, this spell cannot impose the lame deformity on a creature with a base speed slower than 20 feet).

With a gesture, you muffle sound around the target, making it unable to yell or otherwise make loud noises. This does not affect spellcasting by the target. The target can still use sonic effects, but the DC of these effects decreases by 2. The target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against sonic effects. The target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks.

You force an evil creature that does not have the evil subtype to momentarily reflect on its past actions and be overcome by grief and conscience. The target immediately drops prone and begins to loudly confess all of its sins and transgressions to the caster for the duration of the spell. The spell immediately ends if you move out of line of sight or if the target is attacked.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Interposing Hand">interposing hand</a></i>, except that it can also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The <i>forceful hand</i> gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +8 bonus for its Strength score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. <i>Forceful hand</i> prevents the opponent from moving closer to you without first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the <i>forceful hand</i> and the target closer to you. The <i>forceful hand</i> can instead be directed to interpose itself, as <i>interposing hand</i> does.

You cast this spell as you strike a creature with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural attack to unleash a concussive blast of force. You deal normal weapon damage from the blow, but also deal an additional amount of force damage equal to 1d4 points per caster level (maximum of 10d4). The force of the blow may be enough to knock the target backward as well. To determine if the target is pushed back, make a combat maneuver check with a bonus equal to your caster level to resolve a bull rush attempt against the creature struck. You do not move as a result of this free bull rush, but it can push the target back if it defeats the target&rsquo;s CMD. A successful Fortitude save halves the force damage and negates the bull rush effect.

This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once <i>foresight</i> is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
</p>

<p>
When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

Furthermore, forested overgrowth imposes a miss chance 10% lower than normal.

You can sense the location of a target creature within range if it is also within 10 feet of a living plant or fungus. You must be able to target the creature by tangible qualities such as its build, clothing texture, size, or tracks, but you need not have line of effect to your target. The fungus or plants near the target serve as a scrying sensor for this spell. Your senses of hearing, smell, and touch extend to all fungus and plants within 10 feet of the target, allowing you to gauge the size and shape of nearby objects and potentially to overhear conversations in which the target is currently participating. Your scent ability and tremorsense extend through this scrying sensor if you have them, but any other special senses you might have do not. For 1 day after casting this spell, you gain a +5 insight bonus on Survival checks to track creatures you sensed via the spell. You can dismiss this bonus on Survival checks.

You cast this spell immediately before you would take an action that requires a d20 roll, such as a skill check, attack roll, or ability check.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Form of the Dragon II">form of the dragon II</a></i> save that it also allows you to take the form of a Huge chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain the following abilities: a +10 size bonus to Strength, a +8 size bonus to Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, fly 120 feet (poor), blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 120 feet, a breath weapon, DR 10/magic, frightful presence (DC equal to the DC for this spell), and immunity to one element (of the same type <i><a href="#Form of the Dragon I">form of the dragon I</a></i> grants resistance to).
</p>

<p>
You also gain one bite (2d8), two claws (2d6), two wing attacks (1d8), and one tail slap attack (2d6). You can use the breath weapon as often as you like, but you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 12d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save for half damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones.

You become a Medium imperial or primal dragon. Druids can choose from the primal dragon (brine, cloud, crystal, magma, or umbral) forms only. You gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a +2 size bonus to your Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 60 feet (poor), darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a breath weapon, and either resistance to one form of energy or some other bonus. You also gain one bite attack (1d8), two claw attacks (1d6), and either a gore attack (1d8) if you assume the form of an imperial dragon or two wing attacks (1d4) if you assume the form of a primal dragon. Your breath weapon, resistance, and any other benefits you gain depend on the type of dragon. You can use the breath weapon only once per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal damage. In addition, some of the dragon types grant additional abilities, as noted below.

<p>
You build upon your targets&rsquo; innate prejudice, stoking it from a simmer to the full flame of hatred. Choose a creature type (if you choose humanoid or outsider, you must also choose a subtype). Targets who hold no ill will toward and have a completely positive opinion of the chosen creatures automatically succeed at their saving throws, while targets with a particular hatred toward the chosen creature (such as the dwarf&rsquo;s hatred racial ability) take a &minus;4 penalty on their saving throws. Targets that fail their saving throws become hostile toward all creatures of the chosen type and never treat them as allies for the spell&rsquo;s duration. Affected creatures take everything creatures of the chosen type do in the worst possible light.
</p>

<p>
Since most creatures don&rsquo;t hold ill-will toward their own race, you can use <i>foster hatred</i> toward a smaller subset of creatures of your chosen type, such as worshipers of Shelyn, in order to focus the hatred onto your chosen targets.

This spell channels a portion of the next spell you cast into magic that heals you. The next instantaneous area damage spell of 3rd level or lower that you cast deals only 75% of its damage, but heals you of a number of hit points equal to the remaining 25% of the spell&rsquo;s damage. For example, if you cast this spell and followed it with a <i>fireball</i> that would normally deal 40 hit points of damage, the <i>fireball</i> instead deals 30 hit points of damage and heals you of 10 hit points of damage. The spell affected by this spell must be cast before the end of your next turn. This spell has no effect on spells that do not deal damage or spells higher than 3rd level. This healing is treated as if you had been affected by a cure or inflict spell (whichever would heal you), and is treated as the same spell level as the area-affecting spell for the purpose of effects that relate to the spell level of cure or inflict spells.

When the caster hoists a flagon and delivers a toast to freedom, the target is transported up to 15 feet from its position to a space of your choice, though that space must be within your line of sight. If the target was prone at the time of casting, you can choose for the target to be standing upon reaching the destination. Furthermore, if the target was bound with nonmagical ropes, manacles, or other restraints, those restraints are not transported with the target, effectively freeing the target from those restraints. If the target is bound by magical restraints, you can bar those restraints from being transported with the target with a successful caster level check against a DC based on the restraints&rsquo; caster level (DC = 11 + the restraining magic item&rsquo;s or spell&rsquo;s caster level).

<i>Freezing sphere</i> creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 40-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.
</p>

<p>
If the <i>freezing sphere</i> strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of a targeted body of water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.
</p>

<p>
You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the <i>freezing sphere</i> bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.

You harness the Irriseni people&rsquo;s palpable fear of their frozen environment and cruel Jadwiga overlords into a haunt that withers defenses against the cold. Any creature that enters the affected area must succeed at a Will save or gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your caster level against any abjuration effect that provides resistance to or protection against cold damage or cold climates. This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. Once every 30 minutes as an immediate action, the haunt attempts a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) against an active abjuration effect currently protecting a creature in the affected area against cold, even if it was active before the creature was haunted or it successfully bypassed the spell resistance imposed by the haunt. Against creatures with multiple layers of protection, these dispel checks start with the highest-level abjuration effects and work their way down the list. Each time the haunt attempts a dispel check, the spell&rsquo;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.

The area of this spell is covered in chilling frost, dealing 2d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within it. Creatures that the spell initially damages must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. The area remains chilled for the spell&rsquo;s duration. Any creature that starts your turn within the spell&rsquo;s area takes 1d6 points of cold damage (Fortitude saving throw for half) but does not become staggered even on a failed saving throw.

A blast of snow suddenly fills an area with a space of 15 feet, immediately taking the shape of a woolly mammoth made of snow with tusks of solid ice. The mammoth has statistics identical to those of a mastodon, except it also has the cold subtype (and thus gains immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire). The frost mammoth obeys your telepathic commands. It allows you or anyone you designate to ride it, and it is treated as if combat trained. At 17th level, a frost mammoth you conjure deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage with each physical attack.

You create a warhammer of magically hardened ice and send it hurling toward the target. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike the target. If hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels you possess (maximum 5d8); half this damage is bludgeoning damage, half is cold damage. The <i>frosthammer</i> counts as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing DR. If the target takes any bludgeoning damage from the hammer, you may attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that target, except you may use your caster level instead of your BAB and your spellcasting ability modifier (Wisdom for clerics, and so on) instead of your Strength modifier.

The spell allows you to channel cold into your very being. If you don&rsquo;t already have the cold subtype, this spell grants you the cold subtype. If you already have the cold subtype, you instead channel the frost from your being outward, creating a 10-foot-radius aura of cold centered on you. Creatures who enter or end their turns in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d8 points of cold damage.
</p>

<p>
Multiple castings of this spell stack; you can cast it once on yourself to gain the cold subtype, then again to manifest the aura of frost around you.

You produce and sustain a single perfect musical note that holds nearby creatures, friend as well as foe, utterly spellbound until you stop singing. Affected creatures are both paralyzed and oblivious to their surroundings so long as you maintain the note.
</p>

<p>
Maintaining this note requires your absolute attention; if you take damage or take any other action, including moving from your current square, the spell instantly ends. Creatures that succeed in their initial saving throw must make a new one for each round they spend within the area of the spell until they fail and become captivated. Creatures with 4 or more Hit Dice greater than your caster level are not affected by this spell. However, those with 4 or more Hit Dice less than your caster level do not receive a saving throw to resist it. The note is so clear and flawless that less than extraordinary attempts to avoid hearing it merely grant targets a bonus on their saving throws. Targets get a +2 circumstance bonus on their saving throw for each barrier between your voice and their ears. This includes such things as a creature stopping up its ears with wax, closing all windows and doors in a nearby building, or even crawling into a barrel and pulling down the top.
</p>

<p>
If a target that had previously made its saving throw loses the benefit of one or more of its barriers it must immediately make a new saving throw. Similarly, any target that had previously failed its saving throw gets a new save each time it gains the protection of a barrier.

</p>

<p>
At any point during the spell&rsquo;s duration while the target remains in range, you can discharge the spell as a standard action, mentally tugging at the ectoplasm to perform a trip combat maneuver, using your caster level instead of your base attack bonus, and using your Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier, whichever is highest, instead of your Strength modifier.

This enchantment causes a creature to be unable to speak intelligibly. Any effort the target makes to talk, in any language, comes out as a useless mix of unconnected words and noises. Even magic words are affected to some extent; the target has a 20% spell failure chance for any spell it attempts to cast with verbal components, and a 20% chance to incorrectly use a command word to activate a magic item.

You imbue a weapon with a faint silvery glow that dimly illuminates a 5-foot square. An affected weapon also easily bypasses the physical defenses of undead creatures, ignoring 5 points of an undead creature&rsquo;s damage reduction, as long as the damage reduction is not DR/epic. For example, attacks with a weapon affected by this spell completely ignore a zombie&rsquo;s DR 5/slashing or reduce a lich&rsquo;s damage reduction to DR 10/bludgeoning and magic.

When you cast this spell, horrible, fungal growths sprout forth all over your body. You develop 1d2+1 of these blisters per 2 caster levels. Each time you are dealt more than 5 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a single attack, one of these blisters bursts, releasing a cloud of harmful spores in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on you. These spores enter the lungs of all living creatures within the cloud that need to breathe and deal 1d6+1 points of damage for every 2 caster levels you have (Fortitude negates). This is a disease effect, and you and plants aren&rsquo;t affected by the spores. It is possible for more than one blister to burst in a single round. If you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, all remaining blisters burst, and the resulting spores deal the cumulative amount of damage.

Once per round as a move action, starting the round after you cast this spell, you can command the mushrooms to release poisonous spores. Each creature adjacent to a mushroom or in a mushroom&rsquo;s square must then succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. The condition of creatures that fail multiple saving throws does not worsen, but each additional failed saving throw adds 1d4 rounds to the duration the creature is sickened.

The mushrooms are Tiny and cannot provide cover, but they are fairly sturdy (AC 7, hp 30, break DC 20). Creatures can move through squares containing mushrooms as normal. When destroyed, a mushroom evaporates and releases one last cloud of spores.

The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains DR 10/magic and becomes immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits. It can&rsquo;t attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in <i>gaseous form</i>. This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials.

The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can&rsquo;t enter water or other liquid. It also can&rsquo;t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its <i>gaseous form</i>. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.

Casting a <i>gate</i> spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
</p>

<p>
Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>gate</i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster&rsquo;s choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
</p>

<p>
A <i>gate</i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate</i> from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Planar Travel:
	<td>	As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell functions much like a <i><a href="#Plane Shift">plane shift</a></i> spell, except that the <i>gate</i> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate</i> from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you&mdash;anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate</i> cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
</p>

<p>
You may hold the <i>gate</i> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.
</p>

<tr>
	<th style="padding-top:10pt">	Calling Creatures:
	<td style="padding-top:10pt">	The second effect of the <i>gate</i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate</i>, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures.
</p>

<p>
In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can&rsquo;t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i><a href="#Lesser Planar Ally">lesser planar ally</a></i> spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; rather than in coin, which could involve complications.
</p>

<p>
Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.
</p>

<p>
Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.
</table>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell such as <i>gate</i> to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.

<p>
A <i>lesser geas</i> places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a <i>geas</i> cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.
</p>

<p>
The <i>geased</i> creature must follow the given instructions until the <i>geas</i> is completed, no matter how long it takes.
</p>

<p>
If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
</p>

<p>
If the subject is prevented from obeying the <i>lesser geas</i> for 24 hours, it takes a &minus;2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another &minus;2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of &minus;8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the <i>lesser geas</i>.

<p>
A <i>lesser geas</i> (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. <i>Dispel magic</i> does not affect a <i>lesser geas</i>.

<p>
A remove curse spell ends a <i>geas/quest</i> spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. <i>Break enchantment</i> does not end a <i>geas/quest</i>, but <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, and <i>wish</i> do.

<p>
Centuries of war with Nex trained the necromancers of Geb to extract every last resource from the mindless undead that make up most of Geb&rsquo;s rank-and-file troops.
</p>

<p>
When you cast this spell, you draw the remains of nearby destroyed undead together and fuse them into a mass of flesh and bone you can then hurl at any foes within range. Three corpses within range of the spell are required for the spell to function. Geb&rsquo;s hammer can be directed to attack one foe within range per round as a move action. It uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, modified by your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever one is highest). On a hit, the corpse hammer deals 1d6 points of damage per three caster levels (to a maximum of 6d6 points of damage).
</p>

<p>
Geb&rsquo;s hammer also has secondary effects based on the nature of the three bodies you use to create it. If the majority used to create Geb&rsquo;s hammer (at least two) were skeletal, the jagged bits of bone cause the corpse hammer to deal slashing damage and increase Geb&rsquo;s hammer&rsquo;s critical threat range to 19&ndash;20. On the other hand, if the majority were fleshy (at least two), the increased mass causes Geb&rsquo;s hammer to deal bludgeoning damage and increase its critical hit damage to &times;3.
</p>

<p>
Undead that have been destroyed by positive energy or a similar effect that does not leave a corpse, like a <i>disintegrate</i> spell, cannot be used to form Geb&rsquo;s hammer.

Keleshite wizards and clerics have always sought to emulate the genies that they bind. The <i>geniekind</i> spell is the result of attempts to gain the power and influence of these proud outsiders without entirely forsaking the caster&rsquo;s own form.
</p>

<p>
Upon casting this spell, you must choose one type of genie to transform into, selecting from djinni, efreeti, marid, or shaitan. You retain your basic physical appearance but shift in some way to become more akin to the genie type you chose. While under the effects of <i>geniekind</i>, you gain a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws against paralysis, poison, sleep, and stunning effects, and a +4 enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus. You also gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution and a +5 bonus on all Diplomacy checks made when interacting with creatures of the same elemental subtype as your chosen genie. In addition, you gain other abilities depending upon the type of genie you choose to assume the form of, as detailed below.

<p>
Casting this spell constitutes performing a rite of sacrifice to the archdevil Mammon, making an offering to the Lord of Erebus and channeling a measure of his disembodied might into a single coin. The power and abilities of this vestige correspond directly to the value of the offering, allowing for three distinct effects.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Corrupted Coin:
	<td>	Making a sacrifice worth 1,500 gp corrupts the focus into a &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; or &ldquo;unlucky&rdquo; coin as per the caster&rsquo;s will for 1 month. Any creature that bears the coin gains a bonus or penalty (decided by the caster at the time of casting) on all Appraise, Bluff, Craft, and Profession checks. This bonus or penalty is equal to 1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). In addition, the coin can produce an effect similar to the spell <i>augury</i> once per day&mdash;its flip producing a weal (heads), woe (tails), or nothing result (landing on the edge). Potentially unknown to the bearer (if different from the caster), the caster can telepathically hear any question asked of the coin and, as a free action, influence the result as he chooses.
<tr>
	<th>	Mammon&rsquo;s Mantle:
	<td>	Making a sacrifice worth 3,000 gp transforms the coin into a kind of infernal aegis for any who swallow the coin. Upon ingesting the coin, the target gains a bonus to Charisma equal to +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bearer&rsquo;s blood also takes on a hue like liquid gold and runs slowly, granting him immunity to poison, disease, and aging effects, and causing him to automatically stabilize if reduced to fewer than 0 hit points. Additionally, the bearer can eat gold to heal himself, regaining 1 hit point for every 20 gold pieces he consumes (materials other than gold provide no benefit). The coin&rsquo;s effects last for 1 day per caster level.
<tr>
	<th>	Gold Guardian:
	<td>	Making a sacrifice worth 6,000 gp allows the focus coin to animate nearby coins. When cast into a pile of 100,000 coins, an animate hoard forms under the control of the caster. The guardian serves for 1 month. After this month, coins begin disappearing from the guardian at a rate of 100 gp per day, reducing the creature&rsquo;s hit points by 1 per day. When the guardian&rsquo;s hit points reach 0, the guardian collapses and the focus coin is destroyed. Coins lost from the guardian can be replaced, restoring any lost hit points.
</table>

<p>
 In addition to the effects of any of these offerings, should the focus coin be swallowed, any being sired or conceived by the creature while the magic is in effect is born as a tiefling (bearing an indirect relation to Mammon himself).

You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see <i><a href="#Raise Dead">raise dead</a></i>). Days spent under the influence of this spell don&rsquo;t count against the time limit.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less unpleasant.

You create a written message of 50 words or fewer, or else an image, a drawing, or a similar diagram. The figment hangs invisible and obscured upon the target surface for the duration of the spell.

</p>

<p>
When you cast the spell, you can choose to incorporate a passphrase into the spell. If you do so, the message is protected as if <i><a href="#Nondetection">nondetection</a></i> had been cast on it for the full duration of the spell, though creatures that cast <i>geomessage</i> on the surface and speak the passphrase ignore the <i>nondetection</i> effect and cause the image to become visible until the caster speaks the passphrase again.
</p>

<p>
Without a passphrase, the message simply remains invisible to those who cast <i>geomessage</i>. Detection methods like <i>detect magic</i> and <i>see invisibility</i> indicate the message&rsquo;s presence but do not reveal its contents.

You cause a column of boiling water to spring forth from any horizontal surface, knocking over creatures directly over it and exposing nearby creatures to searing droplets as its spray falls back to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Any creature entering the <i>geyser</i>, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the <i>geyser</i> (e.g., if the <i>geyser</i> is 50 feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the <i>geyser</i>. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the <i>geyser</i> (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the <i>geyser</i> but still adjacent to it).
</p>

<p>
This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature&rsquo;s normal movement.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the <i>geyser</i> sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the <i>geyser</i>&rsquo;s height (e.g., a 50-foot <i>geyser</i> has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them.
</p>

<p>
You can choose to make a smaller <i>geyser</i> than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that&rsquo;s smaller than what would be created by a full-height <i>geyser</i> spell.

You alter the fundamental substance of a single object up to 2 cubic feet per level in size and at least one size category smaller than the target creature, causing it to become shadowy and intangible, as though made out of quasi-real shadowstuff. You link the intangible item to the target&rsquo;s flesh by making a brand shaped like the item on the target&rsquo;s skin. The intangible item merges with the target&rsquo;s flesh and is contained within the target&rsquo;s body, moving with the target wherever it goes. The creature can retrieve the item or reabsorb it as a full-round action, and can do so as many times as it wants. When worn or wielded by the target, the item regains its solidity and functions normally, though the target can&rsquo;t drop or remove the item (other than by using the full-round action), nor can it be disarmed or stolen. If the item is destroyed, the spell ends. If the <i>ghost brand</i> spell is dispelled while the object is inside the target&rsquo;s body, the object bursts out of the target&rsquo;s flesh, dealing 3d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to the target that bypasses DR, as well as 1d6 points of bleed damage.

<i>Ghost sound</i> allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound <i>ghost sound</i> creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound&rsquo;s basic character.

<p>
The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a <i>ghost sound</i> spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans. Anyone who hears a <i>ghost sound</i> receives a Will save to disbelieve.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ghost sound</i> can enhance the effectiveness of a <i>silent image</i> spell.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ghost sound</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

A white, 15-foot-long lash of ghostly evanescence appears from your hand. This weapon is treated as a <i>ghost touch whip</i> with no enhancement bonus. You can wield it as a whip as if you were proficient. Attacks with a <i>ghost whip</i> are resolved as incorporeal touch attacks. The whip affects only creatures you attack with it, passing through objects and other creatures in its path and thereby allowing you to ignore cover between you and your target. When a <i>ghost whip</i> attack passes through total cover, the target is treated as having total concealment (50% miss chance). Against incorporeal and undead creatures, a <i>ghost whip</i> deals lethal damage and can be used to perform drag or reposition combat maneuvers (in addition to a whip&rsquo;s normal disarm and trip maneuvers). A <i>ghost whip</i> cannot be disarmed or sundered.

<p>
This spell conjures a Large, quasi-real, wolflike creature made of roiling black smoke. It functions as <i><a href="#Phantom Steed">phantom steed</a></i>, except as noted above. In addition, the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature with fewer than 6 Hit Dice within 30 feet (except the ghost wolf&rsquo;s rider) must make a Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed&rsquo;s fear aura for 24 hours.
</p>

<p>
The ghost wolf may also be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the ghost wolf to attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 points of damage); unlike an animal mount, this does not require a Ride check or any training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only 1 round per level thereafter.

You make yourself&mdash;including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment&mdash;appear translucent like a ghost. Any mundane or magical disguise on you is affected by this illusion as well; for example, if you are disguised as the king or a sahuagin, you look like a ghostly version of the king or a sahuagin. Your ghostly form may have a pale green, blue, or violet coloration, or a muted version of your normal appearance.

The spell does not actually make you ghostly or provide any incorporeal abilities.

You awaken an unnatural hunger in the target, compelling it to fall upon a nearby helpless or dead humanoid creature and begin eating its flesh. The target defends itself normally but takes no other actions while eating. The target does not take extraordinary risks to satisfy this urge (it wouldn&rsquo;t jump over a pit or swim through lava to reach a suitable victim). If the target can&rsquo;t fulfill this urge on its next turn, the spell fails. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.

A paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become sickened (Fortitude negates). A <i>neutralize poison</i> spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench. This is a poison effect.

You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider). The number of vermin which can be affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on the table below.
</p>

<p>
Giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (&ldquo;Attack,&rdquo; &ldquo;Defend,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them.

Developed by priests of Abadar to catch thieves and skimmers, <i>gilded whispers</i> later spread to other faiths and was adapted to the arcane arts through the combined efforts of Aram Zey and Kreighton Shaine. Pathfinders most commonly use this spell to track bribes and illicit purchases back to their ultimate source, especially when they suspect the influence of Aspis Consortium agents.
</p>

<p>
<i>Gilded whispers</i> allows you to use a single coin as a conduit for an eavesdropping spell. When you use a divination (scrying) spell or item, such as <i>clairvoyance/ clairaudience</i>, <i>scrying</i>, or a <i>crystal ball</i>, you can choose to target a coin you have affected with <i>gilded whispers</i> instead of a creature or location (even if you would not otherwise be able to target an object), though any range limits on the <i>scrying</i> effect still apply. If the coin is held or carried by a creature, its owner receives any applicable saving throw against the effect. The caster of <i>gilded whispers</i> treats the coin as a familiar subject. The residual psychic impressions left upon the coin by other handlers help mask this dweomer from detection, protecting <i>gilded whispers</i> against location by <i>detect magic</i>, <i>arcane sight</i>, and similar effects unless the latter spell&rsquo;s caster succeeds on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast <i>gilded whispers</i>.
</p>

The scrying sensor created by using a divination (scrying) spell to observe or listen to the coin&rsquo;s surroundings can be detected as normal.

You expand your consciousness in an attempt to tap into the perfect knowledge contained within the Akashic Record.

The information contained within the Akashic Record can be overwhelming when accessed in this fashion, so your mind partitions it away until needed. For the next day, you can activate the knowledge gained from the Akashic Record as a free action; when you do so, you gain a circumstance bonus equal to your caster level on all skill checks, ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and combat maneuver checks for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the overwhelming nature of the Akashic Record assaults your psyche, causing you to be stunned for 2 rounds and then sickened for 1 minute.

An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast through or out of the magical globe.
</p>

<p>
Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.
</p>

<p>
Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.
</p>

<p>
If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i> stops it.

Upon casting this spell, a rippling bubble of calm water extends outward from you to a radius of 20 feet and remains centered on you when you move. The bubble blocks all natural and magical precipitation such as rain, snow, and hail (including spells such as <i>ice storm</i>). This bubble also pushes out any fog or mist within the area, though it does not affect temperature and can&rsquo;t block natural or magical lightning.
</p>

<p>
All water in this radius counts as calm water for the purposes of Swim checks, and the bubble prevents sprays and blasts of mundane and magic water from striking with enough force to deal damage, move creatures or halt their movement, or perform any action that requires an attack roll or combat maneuver check.

You create one or more bolts of negative energy infused with shadow pulled from the Shadow Plane. You can fire one bolt, plus one for every four levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of three bolts at 13th level) at the same or different targets, but all bolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and require a ranged touch attack to hit. Each bolt deals 4d6 points of damage to a living creature or heals 4d6 points of damage to an undead creature.

You cover a solid surface with a layer of sticky glue. Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must attempt a Reflex save. Those who fail become entangled, but can break free by succeeding at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The area of the spell is considered difficult terrain. A creature moving through the glue must succeed at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as part of its move action (DC = the spell&rsquo;s DC). Creatures that fail lose their movement and become entangled in the first square they enter.
</p>

<p>
The spell can also be used to create a sticky coating on an item. A creature holding a targeted item can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the spell&rsquo;s DC. If the initial saving throw succeeds, the item is unaffected. If it fails, the item is stuck in place. If an affected item is connected to another item (such as a sword in a sheath or a cork in a potion bottle), it cannot be separated from the other item unless the creature succeeds at a combat maneuver check or a Strength check as a move action to free it (DC = the spell&rsquo;s DC). A creature must succeed at saving throw each time it attempts to use the sticky item; otherwise, the item becomes stuck to the creature. Sticky armor or clothing imposes a &minus;10 circumstance penalty on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple attempted by the wearer, as well as to the wearer&rsquo;s CMD to avoid being grappled.

<p>
This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A <i>glyph of warding</i> can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.
</p>

<p>
You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level.
</p>

<p>
Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded.
</p>

<p>
When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.
</p>

<p>
Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. <i>Mislead</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>nondetection</i> (and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can&rsquo;t. <i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>glyph of warding</i> with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).
</p>

<p>
<i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as <i>glyph of warding</i> are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a glyph, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>glyph of warding</i>.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Blast Glyph:
	<td>	A <i>blast glyph</i> deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster&rsquo;s choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.
<tr>
	<th>	Spell Glyph:
	<td>	You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack.Saving Throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The <i>grasping hand</i> can instead be directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as <i>interposing hand</i> does.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Black Tentacles">black tentacles</a></i>, except the tentacles blindly grasp at the targets&rsquo; eyes and ears, and tug at their hair, clothes, and equipment. Instead of grapple attempts, the tentacles attempt dirty trick combat maneuver checks (CMB = your caster level + 4 &#91;the tentacles&rsquo; Strength bonus&#93; + 1 &#91;the tentacles&rsquo; size bonus&#93;).

You cause a long, thin vine to sprout from your body&mdash;typically from the center of your chest or from the palm of an outstretched hand. As a standard action, you can direct the end of the vine to move to any square within 20 feet of you and perform one of the following tasks: deliver a touch spell that you cast after the vine has grown, pick up an unattended object weighing 20 pounds or less, give a held object to another creature, attempt to disable a trap or lock using your Disable Device modifier with a &minus;2 penalty, or perform any other task that the GM deems reasonable. The vine does not threaten squares and cannot make attacks of opportunity, nor can it wield weapons.

With this spell and a touch, you can force a corpse talk to you, but you can&rsquo;t ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all. The corpse will start babbling for 1 round, spitting out random sentences. There is a 10% chance this information is of some use to the caster, but it is difficult to distinguish whether the information is useful (the GM makes the percentile roll in secret).
</p>

<p>
Useful information may include warnings about dangers deeper in a dungeon, the command word to a magic item, or even vague and spectral warnings of your or your companions&rsquo; future. The GM decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.

Once a corpse has been subject to <i>grave words</i> by any caster, any new attempt to cast <i>grave words</i> on that corpse fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the head of the corpse must have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell doesn&rsquo;t affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

<i>Gravity bow</i> significantly increases the weight and density of arrows or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant before they strike their target and then return them to normal a few moments later. Any arrow fired from a bow or crossbow you are carrying when the spell is cast deals damage as if one size larger than it actually is. For instance, an arrow fired from a Medium longbow normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if fired from a <i>gravity bow</i>. Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses your bow to make an attack the arrows deal damage as normal for their size.

You affect the local gravity field in a 30-foot-radius sphere around the spell&rsquo;s designated point of origin. Creatures in the affected area can be weighed down by high gravity, lightened by low gravity, or left to float in an area with no gravity, depending on the effect you choose for your <i>gravity sphere</i>.
</p>

<p>
Creatures that fall within the area of a <i>gravity sphere</i> spell take more damage from the fall if the gravity within is higher and less damage if the gravity within is lower. However, if the creature falls through a <i>gravity sphere</i> and continues to fall in a non-affected area, the rest of the fall damage is calculated normally. For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a low <i>gravity sphere</i> and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low gravity plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).
</p>

<p>
This spell doesn&rsquo;t counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect gravity; both effects occur simultaneously. For instance, a no-gravity <i>gravity sphere</i> spell cast within the area of a <i>reverse gravity</i> spell would simply mean that creatures float about until the <i>gravity sphere</i>&rsquo;s duration expires or they exit the <i>gravity sphere</i>, at which point they return to the top of the <i>reverse gravity</i> effect&rsquo;s area. If both gravity-altering magical effects could not feasibly take place simultaneously (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion), the <i>gravity sphere</i> spell supersedes the previous effect (if it&rsquo;s higherlevel than the previous effect) or simply fails (if it&rsquo;s lower-level).

You bring into being a localized region of increased gravity that crushes a creature to the ground. Affected targets weigh twice as much as normal, can move only at half speed, jump only half as far as normal, and can lift and carry only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by two steps (from good to poor, for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fly check to remain in the air.
</p>

<i>Freedom of movement</i> negates the effects of this spell. A creature targeted by <i>gravity well</i> behaves normally in the area of a <i>reverse gravity</i> spell.

A <i>grease</i> spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery <i>grease</i>. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of <i>grease</i> at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can&rsquo;t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.
</p>

<p>
The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.
</p>

<p>
Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the <i>greased</i> item. A creature wearing <i>greased</i> armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.

<p>
You cause the target to transform into a plant over time. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to infect the target. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and the spell ends. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires. It can&rsquo;t recover this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target&rsquo;s skin might turn green and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target&rsquo;s skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment.
</p>

<p>
If the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub. This final transformation is instantaneous, ending <i>green caress</i>. The target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn&rsquo;t occur and the spell ends. Any changes in appearance gradually reverse themselves as the ability damage heals.
</p>

<p>
<i>Break enchantment</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, and <i>remove curse</i> can end the spell before the duration expires, but the spell is contagious. If a caster level check attempt to remove <i>green caress</i> fails by 5 or more, the creature who attempted to remove the effect must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as if it had just been targeted with the spell. If the spell&rsquo;s target attempts to remove the effect from itself and fails, it causes the spell to behave as if affected by <i>plant growth</i> (as described below).
</p>

<p>
<i>Polymorph any object</i> ends the spell and totally restores the target without any risk to the caster, even after the target has been finally transformed, as do <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, and <i>wish</i> (treat <i>polymorph any object</i> as if it had an instantaneous duration if it is used in this way). If the target is in the area of a <i>plant growth</i> spell as it is cast, it must attempt a Fortitude save at <i>green caress</i>&rsquo;s DC or immediately take another 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score; this stacks with multiple castings of <i>plant growth</i>. If the target is in the area of <i>diminish plants</i> as it is cast, it ignores the next ability damage from <i>green caress</i> to one of its three physical ability scores (chosen randomly); this doesn&rsquo;t stack with multiple castings of <i>diminish plants</i>.

<p>
You bind spirits of ill fate to an object, focusing their wrath onto the next creature that touches the object. When a creature touches the target object, it can attempt a Will save to negate the spell&rsquo;s effect. Although a successful save prevents the creature from becoming haunted, the haunt still resides within the object, and targets either the next creature to touch the object or the same creature again if it still holds the object after 24 hours. The haunt remains within the object until a creature fails its save or the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.
</p>

<p>
Once a creature is affected by the haunt, it begins noticing a large, black mastiff with ominous green eyes watching and following it from a distance, always just beyond the range of focus or interaction. The grim stalker terrorizes the creature&rsquo;s sleep, affecting it as per <i><a href="#Nightmare">nightmare</a></i> every night during the spell&rsquo;s duration (Will negates for one night). Each time the creature takes hit point damage, the grim stalker lunges closer, causing the creature to become shaken for 1 round (Will negates). Each time the creature is reduced to less than one-tenth of its maximum hit points, the grim stalker lunges at the creature as an immediate action, affecting it as per <i><a href="#Phantasmal Killer">phantasmal killer</a></i>.
</p>

<p>
Each time the grim stalker lunges at the affected creature, the spell&rsquo;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round. Alternatively, a haunted creature can attempt to force the grim stalker to manifest using a simple ritual that requires a successful Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Spellcraft check; occult reagents costing 450 gp (which are consumed as part of the ritual); and a full-round action. The DC for this check equals the spell&rsquo;s save DC. Successfully performing the ritual causes the grim stalker to manifest as a Nessian warhound in an available square 20 feet away from the victim, save that its only subtype is extraplanar, its alignment is neutral, its bite and breath weapon deal negative energy damage instead of fire damage, and it has negative energy affinity instead of fire immunity and vulnerability to cold. The grim stalker immediately attacks the affected creature, persisting until either it or the creature is slain, at which point the spell effect (and the warhound) disappears.

You touch an unattended, nonmagical object to create a touchstone for humans defending the area. Such human defenders are protected by a shimmering aura as long as they are in the area. The spell grants each subject damage reduction 2/magic. Humans who leave the area and reenter regain the damage reduction. The spell is suppressed if the object is moved from its place, but resumes if the object is put back. Its duration continues to elapse while it is suppressed this way.
</p>

<p>
Normally, the area of effect is 40 feet from the touched object. If the touched object is a monument to human achievement, the area increases to a 60-foot radius.

You gain a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against the selected special attack. The bonus does not apply to saves against other monsters&rsquo; abilities of the same name, spell-like abilities, or special attacks derived from class levels or equipment.

This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold or fortress by creating a number of magical wards and effects. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Fog:
	<td>	Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.
<tr>
	<th>	Arcane Locks: All doors in the warded area are <i><a href="#Arcane Lock">arcane locked</a></i>.  Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.
<tr>
	<th>	Webs:

These strands are identical with those created by the <i><a href="#Web">web</a></i> spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for <i>web</i>. Spell Resistance: no.
<tr>
	<th>	Confusion:
	<td>	Where there are choices in direction&mdash;such as a corridor intersection or side passage&mdash;a minor <i>confusion</i>-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: yes.
<tr>
	<th>	Lost Doors:
	<td>	One door per caster level is covered by a <i><a href="#Silent Image">silent image</a></i> to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: no.
</table>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.
<ol>
	<li>	<i><a href="#Dancing Lights">Dancing lights</a></i> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.
	<li>	A <i><a href="#Magic Mouth">magic mouth</a></i> in two places. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.
	<li>	A <i><a href="#Stinking Cloud">stinking cloud</a></i> in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for <i>stinking cloud</i>. Spell Resistance: no.
	<li>	A <i><a href="#Gust of Wind">gust of wind</a></i> in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: yes.
	<li>	A <i><a href="#Suggestion">suggestion</a></i> in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the <i>suggestion</i> mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates.  Spell Resistance: yes.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A <i>dispel magic</i> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful mage&rsquo;s disjunction destroys the entire <i>guards and wards</i> effect.

You form a bond with your surroundings when you cast this spell.

You befuddle the target&rsquo;s mind, making it more willing to believe even the most outlandish tales. The target takes a &minus;10 penalty on Sense Motive checks for the spell&rsquo;s duration. In addition, creatures that attempt to lie to or deceive the target gain a +10 bonus on their Bluff checks, as if the target wanted to believe them and was drunk or impaired simultaneously. Furthermore, the believability of any lie told to a creature under the effects of <i>gullibility</i> increases by one step; an impossible lie seems far-fetched, a far-fetched lie seems unlikely, and an unlikely lie seems believable.
</p>

<p>
A creature gains no benefits from <i>glibness</i> on Bluff checks to lie to or deceive a creature that is under the effects of <i>gullibility</i>; in effect, <i>gullibility</i> renders a target so willing to believe what others say that <i>glibness</i> cannot make their words any more believable.

This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a &minus;4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown back 2d6 &times; 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the force of the wind.
</p>

<p>
A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 &times; 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.
</p>

<p>
Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind.
</p>

<p>
Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
This spell can&rsquo;t move a creature beyond the limit of it&rsquo;s range.
</p>

<p>
Any creature, regardless of size, takes a &minus;4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a <i>gust of wind</i>.
</p>

<p>
The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the effects noted, a <i>gust of wind</i> can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.
</p>

<p>
<i>Gust of wind</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

A swirling ball of wind rolls in whichever direction you point, hurling those it strikes with great force. The sphere is treated in all ways as an area of severe wind, applying a &minus;4 penalty on ranged weapon attacks that pass through it. The sphere moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space containing a Medium or smaller creature, it stops moving for that round and generates a sharp thrust of wind to bull rush the creature. The sphere&rsquo;s CMB for bull rush combat maneuvers uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +2 bonus for its Strength score (14). Whether or not the bull rush is successful, the creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage from the attack. If the bull rush fails, the creature is still subject to the severe winds from the sphere as long as they remain in the same square as it. A <i>gusting sphere</i> rolls over objects or barriers that are less than 4 feet tall.
</p>

<p>
The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest. A <i>gusting sphere</i> immediately dissipates if it exceeds the spell&rsquo;s range.

You render the affected creature supernaturally delicious, making it the preferred target for animalistic monsters, as well as biting insects, stray animals, and vermin. A creature that makes a successful bite attack against or otherwise ingests a portion of the victim (such as with drain blood or swallow whole) gains a number of temporary hit points equal to half your caster level. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

You grant the touched target the ability to ascertain the weaknesses of foes. The target deals an additional 1d6 points of precision damage on successful attacks with daggers or slings against foes within 30 feet, as long as the attacked foe is denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class or is flanked by the target. This additional damage increases by 1d6 for every 4 caster levels you have beyond 3rd, to a maximum of 5d6 at 19th level. This bonus damage is precision damage and stacks with other sources of precision damage, such as sneak attack. This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Once per round on a successful attack that deals this precision damage, the target can choose to forgo 2d6 points of precision damage (either granted by this spell or from other sources of precision damage, such as sneak attack) to inflict one of the following conditions on the attacked foe for 1 round:
<ul>
	<li>	The attacked foe can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity against creatures smaller than it.

<i>Hallow</i> makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site.
</p>

<p>
This has four major effects.
</p>

<p>
First, the site is warded by a <i><a href="#Magic Circle Against Evil">magic circle against evil</a></i> effect.
</p>

<p>
Second, the DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist negative energy is reduced by 4. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.
</p>

<p>
Third, any dead body interred in a <i>hallowed</i> site cannot be turned into an undead creature.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can fix a single spell effect to the <i>hallowed</i> site.
</p>

<p>
The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect.
</p>

<p>
You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting <i>hallow</i> again.
</p>

<p>
Spell effects that may be tied to a <i>hallowed</i> site include <i>aid</i>, <i>bane</i>, <i>bless</i>, <i>cause fear</i>, <i>darkness</i>, <i>daylight</i>, <i>death ward</i>, <i>deeper darkness</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>dimensional anchor</i>, <i>discern lies</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>endure elements</i>, <i>freedom of movement</i>, <i>invisibility purge</i>, <i>protection from energy</i>, <i>remove fear</i>, <i>resist energy</i>, <i>silence</i>, <i>tongues</i>, and <i>zone of truth</i>. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells&rsquo; effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.) An area can receive only one <i>hallow</i> spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. <i>Hallow</i> counters but does not dispel <i>unhallow</i>.

You transform the decor of a courtyard, structure, or other edifice to meet your highest standards and personal tastes. Objects and architectural elements remain in the same configuration&mdash;a chair remains a chair&mdash;but can look, sound, and smell like a different physical material and artistic style. You cannot change the appearance of natural terrain, but landscaped areas such as a garden or orchard can be affected. This spell functions in all other ways as <i><a href="#Hallucinatory Terrain">hallucinatory terrain</a></i>.

<p>
Members of the Prophet of Kalistrade prestige class can cast this spell, even though it is not a divination or enchantment.

Dark gray smoke seeps from your eyes, ears, and mouth for the spell&rsquo;s duration, though the smoke doesn&rsquo;t significantly hamper your vision. Upon casting the spell, you may immediately exhale the smoke in a 30-foot cone or do so in a later round as a standard action, ending the spell. Each living creature caught within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round per caster level as it is wracked with waves of nausea and disorienting visions. If it succeeds at its Fortitude save, the creature is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds.

You cause the target rope to shrink and reshape itself into an arrow, bolt, or similar piece of ammunition, which you can shoot at any Medium or larger object. With a successful attack roll against an AC equal to 5 plus the hardness of the target object, the <i>handy grapnel</i> strikes and embeds itself in that object with the strength of an iron grappling hook.
</p>

<p>
As a move action, you can command the rope to extend from the arrow. If you are within a distance equal to the length of the rope and have a hand free, the end of the rope swings directly into your hand. With another move action, you can command the <i>handy grapnel</i> to retract itself up to the grappling hook, pulling up any creature or object supported by the rope at a speed of 50 feet per round.
</p>

<p>
Once embedded, the rope can be used for climbing or any other purpose a rope could serve, and it can bear up to 200 pounds per level of the caster at a time (maximum 1,000 pounds). If this weight limit is exceeded, the <i>handy grapnel</i> comes loose and any creature or object supported by the rope falls.

<p>
You use a Harrow deck to tell a fortune for yourself or someone else. If you cast <i>harrowing</i> on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A <i>harrowing</i> must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, &ldquo;hunting down the pirate king,&rdquo; or &ldquo;traveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword&rdquo;) that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell&rsquo;s duration.
</p>

<p>
If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card&rsquo;s alignment matches the target creature&rsquo;s alignment. If the card and target&rsquo;s alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit&rsquo;s check. If the card and target&rsquo;s alignments are of the opposite alignment; see below, the card inflicts a &minus;1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit&rsquo;s check.
</p>

<p>
While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the <i>harrowing</i> persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can &ldquo;spend&rdquo; at any time to modify that card&rsquo;s associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a <i>harrowing</i> are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack.
</p>

<p>
Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a <i>harrowing</i>, or once the spell&rsquo;s duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed.
</p>

<p>
A single creature can only be under the effects of one <i>harrowing</i> at a time. If it is subjected to a second <i>harrowing</i> while a previous <i>harrowing</i> is still in effect, the new <i>harrowing</i> automatically fails.

Subjects of a <i>greater harrowing</i> spell record and spend their accumulated bonuses and penalties individually, according to their own alignment.

Each participant in a <i>greater harrowing</i> can gain a special ability to seize control of fate if a card that matches that participant&rsquo;s alignment is drawn.

You touch a creature and temporarily absorb its knowledge for yourself. If the target fails its saving throw, you can sort through its lore and memories. You can retrieve one answer to a specific question per minute, as through sifting through the creature&rsquo;s surface thoughts with <i><a href="#Detect Thoughts">detect thoughts</a>`</i>. Alternatively, you can tap into the target&rsquo;s learned experiences and attempt one Knowledge check in a skill in which the target has at least 1 rank, using the target&rsquo;s total skill modifier. Each Knowledge check requires 1 minute and allows the target another Will save to resist the effect. If the target successfully resists, the spell does not end, but you are unable to attempt another Knowledge check for that skill using this spell. You can also use this spell against targets trapped in magic items or spells that hold their bodies or souls, such as an <i>iron flask</i> or the spell <i>trap the soul</i>, by touching the associated receptacle.

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.
</p>

<p>
When making a full attack action, a <i>hasted</i> creature may make one extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature&rsquo;s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a <i>speed</i> weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can&rsquo;t use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A <i>hasted</i> creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
</p>

<p>
All of the <i>hasted</i> creature&rsquo;s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject&rsquo;s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature&rsquo;s jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple <i>haste</i> effects don&rsquo;t stack. <i>Haste</i> dispels and counters <i>slow</i>.

A living creature that dies during the spell&rsquo;s duration cannot be affected by <i>breath of life</i> or similar effects, and the period during which attempts to restore the target to life can succeed is reduced to 1 hour/level (for <i>raise dead</i>), 1 day/level (for <i>resurrection</i>), or 10 days/level (for <i>true resurrection</i>). <i>Reincarnate</i> and similar effects work normally on a creature killed under this spell&rsquo;s effects.
</p>

<p>
An undead creature affected by this spell cannot gain temporary hit points, and any existing channel resistance the undead may have is reduced by half as long as the curse persists.
</p>

<p>
Creatures whose souls are separate from their bodies (such as liches) or are merged with their bodies (such as non-native outsiders) are unaffected by <i>hasten judgment</i>.

As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate check to make the target act friendly to you. If you succeed, the target assists you normally, but it remains fearful of your retribution even after its attitude shifts to unfriendly. If the creature reports your coercion to authorities, attacks you, or otherwise acts in a purposeful way that threatens you or your objectives (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion), the spell triggers, inflicting the creature with the unshakable certainty that you will find and punish it. This imposes the shaken condition on the creature for 1 day per caster level; during this time, the creature takes a &minus;2 penalty on saving throws against spells you cast with the fear descriptor.

It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.

You unleash a blast of holy flames that washes over all creatures in the area in a glorious display of divine power. This deals damage to evil creatures and heals good creatures in the area. The amount of damage dealt and the number of hit points restored in each case is 1d8 points per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8).

<p>
Half of the damage this spell deals to evil creatures is fire damage, and half of the damage is pure divine power that is therefore not subject to reduction by energy resistance to fire-based attacks.

<p>
Neutral enemies within the spell&rsquo;s area of effect also take the fire damage, but do not take the divine damage. Neutral allies within the area are healed by half as much as good creatures. A successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage taken in all cases.

With this spell you can steal the healing of the target creature. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to strike the target. If you do, until the effect ends, whenever your target is subject to a healing spell or a supernatural effect that heals hit points, the target only receives half the healing (rounded down) and you receive the other half (also rounded down). You must remain within 25 feet (plus 5 feet per two caster levels) of the target to gain this benefit. If you move outside that range, the spell is discharged. Once you steal 5 hit points per your caster level (maximum 50 hit points) of healing from this spell&rsquo;s effect, the spell is discharged.

<p>
You imbue one touched holy symbol per 3 caster levels with a connection to your own divine power, turning the touched holy symbols into tokens of healing. Each of the targeted holy symbols can represent any deity regardless of the deity&rsquo;s actual alignment.
</p>

<p>
As long as you wear or carry your divine focus, any creature carrying a token of healing can make a plea for healing in a language you understand as a standard action. When they do this, you are silently alerted to the plea for healing and can magically heal the target as an immediate action anytime before the end of your next turn.
</p>

<p>
The magical healing you use to do this can be either a supernatural ability that heals damage (if you have uses available) or a spell or spell-like ability that belongs to the healing subschool (if you can cast any). In either case, to use the ability or cast the spell through this spell, you must be able to include or target that creature, and the ability&rsquo;s activation time or spell&rsquo;s casting time must be no longer than one standard action.
</p>

<p>
If the ability or healing spell you use through a token would affect multiple creatures, such as <i>mass cure light wounds</i>, the ability or spell affects the creature that pleaded for healing as well as any other creatures within the healing spell&rsquo;s normal range that are also holding a holy symbol imbued with this spell.
</p>

<p>
So, for example, when you use <i>mass cure light wounds</i> through a holy symbol that has been turned into a token of healing, that spell would heal the creature holding the token that pleaded for healing as well as one creature per level that is also holding a token (no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart). However, the <i>mass cure light wounds</i> spell would heal only creatures within range that are holding tokens.

<i>Heat metal</i> causes metal objects to become red-hot.
</p>

<p>
Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature&rsquo;s possession uses the creature&rsquo;s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

<p>
A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it&rsquo;s not wearing or wielding such an item.
</p>

<p>
On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell&rsquo;s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, and causes more damage, as shown on the table presented on the following page.

You badger and nitpick the subject of your spell until its mood sours. The target&rsquo;s attitude shifts one category toward hostile regarding you and everyone within 30 feet of the target at the time the spell is cast. The target also takes a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws, and on ability and skill checks that rely on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

A weapon made from divine force appears and floats near you. This weapon takes the shape of your deity&rsquo;s favored weapon (if you have no deity, the weapon appears as a simple weapon with special significance to you). You gain one additional weapon at 6th level and every 4 caster levels thereafter&mdash;two at 6th, three at 10th, four at 14th, and a maximum of five weapons at 18th level. The weapon averts and deflects attacks, granting you a +1 deflection bonus to AC for each weapon summoned (maximum +5 at 18th level). As a standard action, you can grasp a weapon and throw it as a ranged attack at any target you can see within 30 feet of you (even if it&rsquo;s a type of weapon that can&rsquo;t normally be thrown). On a successful hit, the weapon deals 2d6 points of force damage to the target. This force weapon has the same threat range and critical multiplier as a standard weapon of its type, but no other special abilities. Because it deals force damage, DR doesn&rsquo;t apply. Each weapon thrown lowers the total deflection bonus to your AC by 1 as it disappears immediately after the attack action. The spell immediately ends once you throw all the weapons.

A blast of hellfire blazes from your hands. You can fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every 4 caster levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of three rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from unholy power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by fire resistance. The rays can be fired at the same target or at different targets, but all rays must be fired simultaneously and aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other.

Upon casting this spell, your tongue transforms into an energy whip weapon that can deal acid, electricity, or fire damage. You choose what type of energy damage the spell deals when you cast it. You attack with your tongue as if it were a whip, except you make touch attacks with it and it can harm creatures with armor or natural armor bonuses. You are considered proficient with this weapon. A successful touch attack with the tongue deals 1d8 points of energy damage per two caster levels (maximum of 5d8 points of damage at 10th level).

You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.
</p>

<p>
When the spell is cast, you specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is done, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away he is, as detailed on the following table.
</p>

<table class=Other>
<thead>
<tr>
	<th>	Distance
	<th>	Time to Locate

<p>
Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears.
</p>

<p>
The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own devices to locate you.
</p>

<p>
If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.
</p>

<p>
If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.
</p>

<p>
The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can&rsquo;t pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.

<p>
You fill your target&rsquo;s mind with blasphemous knowledge. If the target fails its saving throw, it cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities for the duration of the spell. Divine spellcasters whose power derives from the worship of a single deity (most clerics, paladins, and warpriests) have the potential to suffer worse. When targeting a divine spellcaster, you can designate an alignment. If the named alignment coincides with either the spellcaster&rsquo;s alignment or that of her deity, the divine spellcaster loses access to all supernatural and spell-like class abilities granted by the associated class for the spell&rsquo;s duration&mdash;blessings, domain powers, channel energy, smite evil, <i>etc</i>.
</p>

<p>
Those affected by this spell can end the effect early by choosing to release the blasphemies in a litany of screamed curses and heretical decadences. The creature is effectively paralyzed for half the spell&rsquo;s duration, and each ally within 50 feet must succeed at a Will saving throw (equal to this spell&rsquo;s save DC) or be shaken until the litany ends. If the creature chooses to do this, it cannot end the litany of blasphemies early. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw to avoid being shaken by its ally&rsquo;s blasphemous litany is immune to the litany&rsquo;s effects and need not attempt additional saves on subsequent rounds.

The targeted creature becomes susceptible to a repeat use of your harmful hexes, even if you could not otherwise target that creature with a particular hex for a certain time period. For example, normally after you target a creature with a charm hex, you cannot target it again for 1 day. But after casting this spell on a creature, you could try the charm hex repeatedly as long as the spell persists. The end of this spell has no effect on any active or ongoing hex on a creature. Fox example, if the creature failed its save against a second use of your charm hex, it remains charmed for the normal duration, even if the spell expires before the hex does.
</p>

<p>
Each subsequent casting of this spell on a target within a 24-hour period gives the target a +4 bonus on its save against the spell and imposes a &minus;4 penalty on your caster level check to overcome the target&rsquo;s spell resistance with this spell.

You place a willing subject into a cataleptic state. It remains aware of its surroundings but is paralyzed, appearing dead unless observers make a DC 20 Heal check. <i>Hibernate</i> delays the effects of poison, disease, and bleed effects for the spell&rsquo;s duration, and half of any hit point damage suffered by the subject is converted to nonlethal damage.

<p>
This subtle but useful spell allows you to safeguard important knowledge&mdash;even from yourself. While casting this spell, you recite one piece of knowledge (up to a maximum of 50 words). Upon completion of the spell&rsquo;s casting, you transfer the knowledge from your mind to your skin in the form of an intricate, runic tattoo placed anywhere you choose on your body. The knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches over gaps in your memory with recollections from the past. Until the spell&rsquo;s duration ends, the knowledge is lost to you. When you cast this spell, you decide how long you wish the spell&rsquo;s duration to be, up to a maximum duration of 1 day per level. Many Cyphermages commission nonmagical tattoos to disguise the effects of this spell. A <i>detect magic</i> spell or a successful Linguistics or Spellcraft check (DC 20 + your Intelligence modifier) reveals an enchanted tattoo, but not its contents. The effects of <i>hidden knowledge</i> can be dispelled normally, in which case the knowledge is completely lost.

You prevent the targets from having conscious awareness of your presence. You make yourself completely undetectable to the subjects by erasing all awareness of your presence from their minds. The targets can&rsquo;t see, hear, smell, feel, or taste you, including with extraordinary or supernatural senses such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. They can&rsquo;t pinpoint your location by any means, including <i>detect</i> spells.
</p>

<p>
The targets remain unaware of your actions, provided you don&rsquo;t make any attacks or cause any obvious or directly threatening changes in the targets&rsquo; environment. If you attack any of the target creatures, the effect ends. If you take an action that creates a sustained and obvious change in the target&rsquo;s environment&mdash;for example, attacking a creature other than a target or moving a sizeable or attended object the target can see&mdash;the target immediately receives a new saving throw.

You spend 1 hour in quiet meditation, holding the focus component in both hands and walking around a natural area. You are simultaneously drawn to areas of natural moisture while drawing that moisture closer. As the spell&rsquo;s casting time concludes, you thrust the focus component into the ground. From that point, a fresh, clean water trickles forth at a rate of 1 gallon every 10 minutes. You cannot cast this spell inside a building or in an area of worked stone, but you can cast it underground. You cannot cast this spell within 1 mile of an existing <i>hidden spring</i>.

You make the area around a campsite appear to be a thicket of untouched and forbidding foliage, or some other unwelcoming feature matching the surrounding terrain. Creatures outside the area cannot sense any activity going on inside the area&mdash;they cannot smell campfires or cooking food, they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those inside the area can see out normally. Once a creature steps into the area of the spell, it can see everything in and around the area normally.

Nonintelligent undead creatures (such as skeletons or zombies) are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there.

If it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, however, it can attempt to find or strike them.

Upon casting this spell, a light or one-handed melee weapon in your hand melds with your flesh, accompanied by a disgusting sucking sound. The weapon disappears completely inside your arm, and thereafter for the duration of the spell, you can extend and retract the weapon as a move action.
</p>

<p>
While extended, the weapon remains partially melded with your hand and arm, providing a +5 bonus to your CMD against disarm combat maneuvers. While the weapon is retracted, its shape adjusts to fit inside your arm, and you retain the use of your hand. Spotting the weapon on casual inspection is impossible, but anyone frisking you can attempt a DC 25 Perception check to notice a light weapon or a DC 20 Perception check to notice a one-handed weapon hidden inside your arm. If the weapon grants a bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to hide it (as does a dagger), the bonus is added to the DC to find the item. Anyone who sees you casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t need to succeed at a Perception check to know you have the hidden weapon.
</p>

<p>
If you cast this spell a second time, you can hide another weapon inside your other arm. You can extend and retract both weapons as part of the same action.

Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract&rsquo;s duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can have only one admixture effect (formula with the words &ldquo;bomb admixture&rdquo; in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active.

<p>
When you throw a bomb and hit a target directly, it affects up to three targets&mdash;the creature the bomb hit directly, and up to two other creatures that take damage from the splash damage (alchemist&rsquo;s choice).

A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.
</p>

<p>
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <i>protection from evil</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.
</p>

<p>
Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.
</p>

<p>
Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and mental influence, just as <i><a href="#Protection from Evil">protection from evil</a></i> does.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a <i>holy aura</i>, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as <i>blindness/deafness</i>, but against <i>holy aura</i>&rsquo;s save DC).

Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid holy air remains. Any creature that steps through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (no save); half of this damage is cold damage, half is damage from holy water (creatures unharmed by holy water do not take the damage).

You must succeed on attack rolls (one per javelin) to hit the target with the javelin, using your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier. The javelins deal 1d6 damage each, plus 1 point of cold damage and 1 point of damage from holy water.

You create a masterwork weapon that has the qualities of ice and holy water. This weapon must be a simple weapon or your deity&rsquo;s favored weapon. The weapon deals normal damage for a weapon of that type, plus 1 point of cold damage per caster level (maximum 10). In addition, any creature struck by the weapon is also hit by holy water, dealing 1d4 points of damage if the creature is susceptible to holy water. If the weapon leaves your hands for more than 1 round, it melts and the spell ends.

You create a shimmering javelin of holy energy to hurl at an enemy as a ranged touched attack. The javelin deals 1d6 points of damage to an evil creature on a successful attack; it dissipates harmlessly against creatures of any other alignment. Each time a creature starts its turn while impaled by the javelin, it takes another 1d6 points of damage. For every 4 caster levels you have, the javelin remains in the creature for an additional round (to a maximum of 5 rounds at 18th level). While the creature remains impaled, it takes a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks. As a move action, the creature (or another adjacent creature) can attempt to pull the javelin out (causing it to immediately disappear) with a DC 12 Strength check.
</p>

<p>
The <i>holy javelin</i> glows like a torch, and this light clearly indicates the impaled creature&rsquo;s location, even if it turns invisible. Since this light is not a light effect, just the glow of a conjured javelin, darkness spells always suppress it, even if they are lower level.

You gain the ability to magically project the defense of your shield to protect another creature at a distance. As a swift action, you designate one target within 30 feet. The target gains your shield&rsquo;s shield bonus and enhancement bonus to Armor Class until your next turn; you gain no benefit from the shield&rsquo;s shield bonus or enhancement bonus while using this spell and cannot use any of the shield&rsquo;s other properties or abilities (such as magical abilities, making a shield bash, or providing cover with a tower shield). As a swift action, you may move the protection to another target (including yourself); if you move the protection to yourself, you may use any of the shield&rsquo;s properties or abilities as normal. If the shielded creature exceeds the 30-foot range, your shield&rsquo;s protection automatically reverts to you. Any circumstance that would make you lose your shield bonus (such as an enemy breaking the shield, you dropping the shield, or you becoming helpless or unconscious) means the protected creature loses the shield&rsquo;s benefit.

A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect.

This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a <i>+5 holy weapon</i> (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a <i><a href="#Magic Circle Against Evil">magic circle against evil</a></i> effect (as the spell). If the <i>magic circle</i> ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand.
</p>

<p>
You cannot have more than one <i>holy sword</i> at a time.
</p>

<p>
If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supercede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with <i>bless weapon</i> or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon&rsquo;s bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.

You befuddle the targets&rsquo; senses, preventing the targets from clearly perceiving their surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Instead, <i>hoodwinked</i> creatures see only the roughest shapes and details and hear only muffled noises. However, targets can clearly hear verbal communication from the spell&rsquo;s caster. This spell does not impart understanding of the caster&rsquo;s language if the creature can&rsquo;t already understand it. Other than to hear the caster speak, targets automatically fail Perception checks with DCs greater than 5, and they are too disoriented by the spell to accurately remember the path they took while under its effects.
</p>

<p>
While under the effects of this spell, targets without the help of a guide move at half speed, and any attacks they make are treated as though the creature they are attacking had concealment. Moving faster than half speed requires targets to succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Those that fail this check fall prone. If the target is attacked or physically harmed by any creature other than another target of <i>hoodwink</i>, the spell&rsquo;s effect ends immediately for that target only.

This spell evaporates moisture from the body of each subject living creature, causing flesh to wither and crack and crumble to dust. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, which instead take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8).

You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as <i><a href="#Mirror Image">mirror image</a></i>, except as noted.
</p>

<p>
Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of <i>mirror image</i>). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock. Both additional effects are mind-affecting fear effects, and spell resistance applies against them.
</p>

<p>
If your campaign uses the sanity system, a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.

You channel residual feelings of terror into the minds of creatures within the area, causing those fears to manifest when confronted with a specific object. All creatures in the area must succeed at a Will save or acquire a phobia for the spell&rsquo;s duration. You choose one kind of creature, object, or image within the area of the spell when it is cast that triggers the phobia. The kind of creature, object, or image that triggers the phobia must be named specifically. A creature type or subtype is not specific enough. The phobia can be cured using traditional methods of treating insanity, and spells or effects that prevent possession or mind control suppress the phobia for their duration. Each time the phobia is triggered in an affected creature, the spell&rsquo;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.

You create a dimensional link to the target creature. When attacked or the subject of a spell that deals damage to you, you can spend an immediate action to cause yourself and the target creature to teleport and switch places. The target then becomes the target of the triggering attack or spell instead of you. If you fail to teleport out of the area of an effect, that effect might still affect you. If the target creature cannot fit safely into the new space without squeezing, or you try to teleport the target into an occupied space or a space it could not normally stand within, the juxtaposition fails. Further, if the target is unconscious or dead when you attempt to switch places, the juxtaposition fails. Once you have used it to teleport once, this spell is discharged.

You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid footing and halving the target&rsquo;s speed. The target also takes a &minus;4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a &minus;1 penalty on attack rolls, the second &minus;2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of &minus;5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &minus;1.

You send wracking pains through the targets&rsquo; bodies. Because of the pain, affected creatures take a &minus;2 penalty to AC, attacks, melee damage rolls, and Reflex saving throws, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC equal to the DC of this spell) to cast spells. However, if an affected creature spends a move action screaming as loudly as possible, it can act without any other penalties for the remainder of its turn. &ldquo;Screaming,&rdquo; for the purposes of this spell, includes any vocalization of pain or its telepathic equivalent; creatures that cannot scream (such as creatures without the natural ability to communicate or vocalize) suffer the full effect of the spell.

Your target&rsquo;s belly distends and its front teeth grow longer and sharper. The creature ravenously craves the flesh of its own kind, gaining the staggered condition as hunger pangs rack its altered body. The target gains a bite attack as a primary natural attack that deals damage appropriate for its size (1d6 if Medium, 1d4 if Small). There&rsquo;s a 25% chance on each of the creature&rsquo;s turns that it can&rsquo;t overcome its hunger. If so, it must move directly toward the nearest corporeal creature of its type and subtype (if applicable) and make a bite attack against it. If the target lacks enough actions to attack on that turn, it moves as close to the creature as it can, but on its next turn, if the percentile dice indicate it overcomes its hunger, the target is not forced to pursue or attack further.
</p>

<p>
On any round after the target deals damage to another creature of its own type and subtype (if applicable) with its bite attack, the target loses the staggered condition. If it doesn&rsquo;t continue dealing bite damage to applicable creatures, the target regains the staggered condition at the beginning of its next turn.

The ground attempts to pull creatures beneath its surface as if hungry for the flesh of mortals.
</p>

<p>
Immediately, and at the beginning of each of your turns, every creature touching the ground within the area of the spell is the target of a grapple combat maneuver. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The ground does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The earth&rsquo;s CMB is equal to 5 + your caster level for the purpose of this combat maneuver check. Attempt the combat maneuver check only once each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.
</p>

<p>
Each time the ground succeeds at a combat maneuver check to grapple a foe, it drags the creature farther down, eventually forcing the creature below its surface. With the first successful check, the target gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents can&rsquo;t move without first breaking the grapple (doing so requires a successful DC 20 combat maneuver or Escape Artist check). The ground receives a +5 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple opponents it is already grappling. After the second successful grapple combat maneuver check, the grappled creature is pulled to the ground and becomes prone. On the third successful grapple combat maneuver check, the creature is fully buried and must hold its breath or begin suffocating.
</p>

<p>
A buried creature can&rsquo;t attempt to escape unless the effect ends or it breaks the grapple. The DC to escape the grapple increases to 25 for a creature that has been pulled beneath the earth.

Your animal companion works in perfect harmony with your mastery of nature.

<p>
Choose one creature type (and subtype, if applicable) from the ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy list. When you cast this spell, the targeted spear hums with destructive energy and functions as a <i>+1 spear</i> against creatures of the selected type.
</p>

<p>
You can discharge this spell in order to make an especially powerful attack with the spear. The spear&rsquo;s critical range becomes 18&ndash;20 and its critical multiplier becomes &times;3. If you make this attack as part of a charge action, you gain an enhancement bonus of +30 feet to your base speed while performing the charge. If you throw the spear as part of this attack, its range increment increases to 80 feet. If you cast this spell on a masterwork spear, it also gains the <i>bane</i> special ability against the selected creature type and automatically bypasses any damage reduction (except DR/&mdash;) regardless of the creature&rsquo;s type. After resolving the attack, the spear is completely destroyed in a burst of energy.
</p>

<p>
Any creature other than you treats the spear as a normal weapon of its type. You can have only one huntmaster&rsquo;s spear in effect at a time. If you cast the spell again, any previous instance of the spell immediately ends. If you expend a monster trophy of the type selected as an optional material component for this spell, you reduce the casting time to 1 round.

This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in the burst.
</p>

<p>
A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4&times;10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6&times;10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.
</p>

Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6&times;10 feet.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Large or larger creatures may move normally within a <i>hurricane blast</i> effect.
</p>

<p>
<i>Hurricane blast</i> can&rsquo;t move a creature beyond the limit of its range. Any creature, regardless of size, takes a &minus;4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a <i>hurricane blast</i>. The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the effects noted, a <i>hurricane blast</i> can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush against any one creature or object.

You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures and obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past. Against creatures and moveable objects this stream acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than your own. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Against immovable objects this stream instead allows you to make a Strength check to destroy the target.

The Break DC depends on the object you&rsquo;re trying to break.

You create a suit of armor made of ice. While cold to the touch, it does not harm the wearer, especially if worn over normal clothing (though it can hasten the effects of exposure in cold environments). It offers the same protection as a breastplate, except it has hardness 0 and 30 hit points. If the intended wearer is immersed in water when you cast this spell, you may form the armor around the wearer (who may be you); otherwise the wearer must don the armor normally. Attacks against the wearer that create heat or fire degrade the armor, reducing its armor bonus by 1 for every 5 points of fire damage the wearer takes; when the armor&rsquo;s bonus to AC reaches 0, the armor is destroyed and the spell ends. Because the ice is slightly buoyant, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Swim checks, except when swimming downward. Druids can wear <i>ice armor</i> without penalty.

Your unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters) plus 1 point of cold damage, and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. You may burrow through nonmagical ice or snow at your base speed as easily as a fish swims through water. You can move through magical ice and snow if you succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect; you automatically succeed on caster level checks against effects that you created.

You can only send the target to a location with which you are very familiar. The target is first trapped in ice (hardness 0, 3 hit points per inch of thickness, 1 inch thick per caster level) for 1d4 rounds, during which time it is paralyzed, aware but unable to take any physical actions, and begins to fade away as the teleportation aspect takes effect. At the end of the 1d4 rounds, the target teleports to the specified location, and the ice&rsquo;s hit points drop to 0 and it quickly melts away.

You create a blast of intense cold, coating all solid surfaces in the area with a thin coating of ice. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and falls prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage and don&rsquo;t fall prone. Spell resistance applies to this initial effect.
</p>

<p>
A creature can walk within or through the area of ice at half its normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure by 4 or less means the creature can&rsquo;t move that round (and must succeed at a Reflex save or fall); failure by 5 or more means it falls. Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to attempt this check.

A 5-foot square of ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points. The ice is an instantaneous effect, but persists as nonmagical ice. Under temperate conditions, the ice lasts 1 minute per level. In tropical environments, it might last only half as long. In cold environments where ice and snow persist without melting, it could last indefinitely.

Favored by the spellcasters of Irrisen, this potent spell can disrupt spellcasters, topple enemies, and break even seemingly unstoppable charges.
</p>

<p>
One or more giant spears of ice lance up out of the ground. Each stalagmite-like icicle affects a 5-foot square and tapers to a height of 10 feet. You may cause a number of <i>ice spears</i> equal to one spear for every 4 caster levels you possess to burst from the ground. A creature that occupies a square from which a spear extends (or that is within 10 feet of the ground below) takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of cold damage per square&mdash;creatures that take up more than 1 square can be hit by multiple spears if your caster level is high enough. The explosive growth can also trip foes. When the spears erupt from the ground, they attempt a combat maneuver check to trip any targets that take damage from the spears, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Each additional <i>ice spear</i> beyond the first that strikes a single foe grants a +10 bonus on this combat maneuver check. If the check is successful, the <i>ice spears</i> knock the foe prone. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the trip attempt.
</p>

<p>
If you cast this spell upon an area covered with ice or snow, such as a glacier, frozen lake, or snow-covered field, the spears strike with additional force. Saves against the effect take a &minus;2 penalty, and the spell effect gains a +4 bonus on the combat maneuver check to trip foes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ice spears</i> created by this spell remain after they do their damage. They melt as normal depending on the surrounding environment. They no longer damage foes in their square, but can provide cover. An <i>ice spear</i> has hardness 5 and 30 hit points.

You trap the target in solid ice 1 inch thick per caster level. If the creature fails its save, it is helpless, but can still breathe (the ice blocks line of effect to the target). If the target makes its save, it gains the entangled condition but can otherwise act normally. Whether or not the target saves, it takes 1 point of cold damage per caster level each round it is helpless or entangled in the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness; if broken, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action with a successful Strength check (DC 15 + your caster level).

A target who can speak and has at least one free hand and who is aware of the spell and its effects (such as from a Spellcraft check to identify the spell as it is cast) can negate one reroll by spending a move action to utter a brief prayer or good luck charm to appease the spirits of ill fortune.

When casting this spell, you create an illusory double that takes the same space of you. That double makes it look like you are standing still, even when you are not. While under the effects of this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you cast a spell, make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, or move out of your first square during a move action. It does not hide ranged attacks made with any type of projectile weapon.
</p>

<p>
When a creature hits you with an attack of any type, it gains a saving throw to disbelieve the figment. On a successful saving throw, it successfully disbelieves and the spell&rsquo;s effect ends for that creature.

You create an illusion that takes the same space as a foe and mimics its movements perfectly. Whenever you cast a spell or throw a weapon, the illusion ceases mimicking the target&rsquo;s actions just long enough to make it look like the target cast the spell or threw the weapon simultaneously with you, such that witnesses who can see both you and the target can&rsquo;t tell with certainty who truly cast the spell or threw the weapon. Witnesses who can see only the target see it as the only apparent source. The subject of this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity from these illusory actions. Each target of the attack or spell counts as interacting with the illusion and thus receives a save to disbelieve.

This spell creates an illusion of a stationary group of people milling about. They can be of any humanoid race or ethnicity you are familiar with, and they speak a language of your choice that you know. To anyone not paying close attention, their conversations sound perfectly normal but are in fact repetitive and essentially meaningless. The crowd appears to be a group of typical citizens, and cannot duplicate any specific group, guild, or military squad.
</p>

<p>
The crowd affects movement and provides cover like a real crowd, but anyone who disbelieves the illusion can move and attack through the crowd without impediment. Each round a creature enters or makes an attack through a crowd-filled square, it can attempt a save to disbelieve the illusion. Similarly, any creature that spends a round listening to or talking to the crowd can attempt a save to disbelieve the illusion. If the group is placed in any terrain other than urban, each creature attempting a save to disbelieve the spell gains a +5 bonus on the save.

<p>
The spell forces the target to believe that nothing in its hoard is missing or has been disturbed. This spell fools all the senses, convincing the target that its hoard feels and behaves as it should. Only if the target tries to use an item from this illusory hoard for some other purpose does it receive another saving throw to disbelieve the effects of the spell (a wizard trying to use an illusory wand or a dragon trying to unlock a door with an illusory key). For the purposes of this spell, a hoard is any amount of treasure that is too big to be carried by the treasure&rsquo;s owner without magical tools such as <i>bags of holding</i> or <i>portable holes</i>, such as a dragon&rsquo;s hoard, a king&rsquo;s treasury, a merchant&rsquo;s strongbox, or a thief&rsquo;s hidden cache.
</p>

<p>
You create a phantasm of an oily green phantasmal poison on the target weapon. The first creature hit by the poisoned weapon must make a Will save against the illusion spell; success means the spell has no effect and is expended from the weapon. If the creature fails its save, it believes it has been poisoned and must make Fortitude saves at the spell&rsquo;s DC to avoid suffering illusory poison damage.
</p>

<p>
<i>Delay poison</i> allows the target to ignore the effects of the phantasmal poison until the <i>delay poison</i> spell ends, at which time it may make a Will save to realize the poison is illusory and recover all illusory poison damage. <i>Neutralize poison</i>, <i>lesser restoration</i>, <i>or restoration</i> immediately recovers all damage from the spell. A successful <i>dispel magic</i> spell ends the effect of the illusion, as do spells that penetrate illusions (such as <i>true seeing</i>).
</p>

The target automatically recovers all illusory poison damage after 1 hour.

You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The <i>illusory script</i> appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it&rsquo;s unintelligible to any other character.
</p>

<p>
Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a <i><a href="#Suggestion">suggestion</a></i> implanted in the script by you at the time the <i>illusory script</i> spell was cast. The <i>suggestion</i> lasts only 30 minutes. Typical <i>suggestion</i>s include &ldquo;Close the book and leave,&rdquo; &ldquo;Forget the existence of this note,&rdquo; and so forth. If successfully dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i>, the <i>illusory script</i> and its secret message disappear.
</p>

This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear. Although the caster can see through his <i>illusory wall</i>, other creatures cannot, even if they succeed at their will save (but they do learn that it is not real).

You transfer a single hex you know to the target, and give that target the ability to use the hex. The transferred hex&rsquo;s variable characteristics function according to your level, not the level of the recipient. Only a creature with Intelligence and Wisdom scores of at least 9 can receive this effect. To use this hex, the target must be able to speak and move freely. Once it uses the hex, the spell ends (though any effects of the hex still last for the full duration). You can transfer only a hex&mdash;not a major or grand hex&mdash;with this ability.
</p>

Once you cast <i>imbue hex</i>, you cannot use the transferred hex until the spell is discharged, dispelled, or dismissed.

You infuse another creature with your divine aura, causing the target to radiate an aura identical to your own clerical aura. The target&rsquo;s actual alignment is not changed, but spells like <i>detect evil</i> or <i>detect good</i> detect only the aura, not the creature&rsquo;s actual alignment. For the duration of this spell, effects influenced by the target&rsquo;s alignment function according to the imposed aura, not the creature&rsquo;s actual aura. When the spell ends, the target&rsquo;s aura returns to normal, and alignmentaffecting magic affects it according to its actual alignment.

You grant a touched Large or smaller object the ability to fly at a speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability. It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed. The targeted object flies as you direct it, using your Fly skill for any difficult maneuvers. You must be within close range (25&rsquo; + 5&rsquo;/2 levels) of the object to direct it, and moving it requires a move action. If not directed, the object hovers in place (no Fly check required).

This spell grants the target magic item temporary intelligence by siphoning off a tiny portion of your own mind to infuse the object. Only permanent magic items may be enhanced by this spell-one-use items and charged items cannot be affected by <i>impart mind</i>. Intelligent magic items cannot be affected by <i>impart mind</i>.
</p>

<p>
When you cast <i>impart mind</i> on a magic item, the item gains an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma score of 10 and gains your alignment. You have no special control over the item once it becomes intelligent, although since it has your alignment, personality conflicts with items you wield won&rsquo;t be a problem. Determine the item&rsquo;s ego normally, as per the rules on intelligent items in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>.
</p>

<p>
An item made intelligent via <i>impart mind</i> communicates via speech and has normal senses to a range of 60 feet. It speaks and reads one language known by you&mdash;if you know multiple languages, you may choose which language the item knows.
</p>

<p>
When you cast <i>impart mind</i> on an item, roll once on Table 15&ndash;24 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> to randomly determine the item&rsquo;s power&mdash;add your caster level to this roll. By expending additional diamond dust in excess of the 1,000 gp worth of material components required to cast this spell, you can gain further bonuses on the d% roll made to determine the item&rsquo;s power. Every additional 100 gp in diamond dust you use in excess grants a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll, up to a maximum additional bonus equal to your caster level. If the item gains the ability to cast a spell, determine the spell it can cast randomly from spells you know of the appropriate level. If the item gains ranks in a skill, it gains ranks in a random skill in which you have at least 1 rank.
</p>

<p>
If you roll above 100, then you can choose one item power on Table 15&ndash;24 in the <i>Core Rulebook</i> to grant the item, and the item gains a special purpose. Roll once on Tables 15&ndash;25 and 15&ndash;26 on page 534 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> to determine what the item&rsquo;s special purpose and dedicated powers are. These d% rolls are not modified by your caster level or any additional powdered gems you used to cast the spell.
</p>

<p>
Once this spell ends, the item reverts to its previous nature&mdash;if you cast this spell on the item again, it gains entirely different powers as determined by a new set of rolls.

<p>
This minor curse interferes with the target&rsquo;s ability to speak. On a failed save, the target has difficulty stringing words together. Only with great concentration can he communicate intelligibly. Speaking in combat becomes a move-equivalent action rather than a free action. If the target attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, he has a 50% chance of making an error and losing the spell. Even if he can successfully cast a spell, doing so takes 1 round if the spell&rsquo;s normal casting time is less than 1 round. If the spell&rsquo;s casting time is usually 1 round or longer, its casting time doubles (up until the end of <i>impede speech</i>). <i>Impede speech</i> cannot be dispelled, but <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish</i> can end it prematurely.

You enchant the target so it is nearly impossible to detect by both magical and mundane means, granting it the following benefits. The target gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to half your caster level, and can use Stealth to hide from all creatures attempting to perceive it, even when it lacks concealment or cover. It can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from creatures using blindsight, blindsense, or any ability that functions as either (such as lifesense or tremorsense). Furthermore, the target leaves no trail and cannot be tracked unless it chooses to leave a trail. If a creature attempts to discern the target&rsquo;s presence or location using divination magic (including magic items with a divination aura such as a <i>crystal ball</i>), that creature must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the target&rsquo;s Stealth bonus to discern any information about the target, and on a failed check cannot do so for the spell&rsquo;s duration.

You implant a false psychometric reading into an object, imbuing the item with misleading information that might be learned from the <i>object reading</i> spell or through the psychometry occult skill unlock. This information might fool enemies, create a false history, or pass on secret messages through objects to psychically attuned allies. You can implant any information you wish that could be implanted by the <i><a href="#Charge Object">charge object</a></i> spell, as well as up to one piece of information per 3 levels that could be attained using psychometry or the <i>object reading</i> spell. You can detail this information in any way you see fit, either making up a previous owner and circumstances involving the object from whole cloth, or attempting to emulate the biographical information and fictional accounts of a specific individual&rsquo;s experience with the object.
</p>

<p>
During the spell&rsquo;s duration, creatures reading the object through the <i>object reading</i> spell or the psychometry occult skill unlock receive this false information in place of an item&rsquo;s true history if they fail a Will saving throw. Creatures that succeed at their saves still detect and receive the false information, but recognize it for what is and are able to discern the fictitious information from the item&rsquo;s true history without difficulty.
</p>

<p>
This spell masks its own magical aura, causing the target to not register as magical to <i>detect</i> spells and similar effects. This masking doesn&rsquo;t conceal any other magical auras on the object, and can be overcome in the same ways as <i>magic aura</i>.

You make the target unconsciously desire a goal you define when you cast this spell. The DC of any Diplomacy check to ask the target to act in a way that it believes will lead it toward that goal decreases by 5. The target takes a &minus;2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that compel it to act in a way that it believes will lead it toward that goal. Spells that reveal the target&rsquo;s goals or thoughts reveal the implanted urge as the target&rsquo;s most important goal and the target does not register as thinking of anything else as long as it is presented with the focus of its urge or a way to move toward its goal. Anyone studying the target&rsquo;s thoughts can notice the implanted nature of this urge with a successful caster level check.

You cause the surrounding area to appear to distort. The angles and corners of the area subtly twist and contort, creating unnatural and impossible shapes. Any creature entering the area must succeed at a Will save or become disoriented. Disoriented characters treat the area as difficult terrain and are sickened. In addition, whenever a disoriented creature uses an action to move (including taking a 5-foot step if it can do so in difficult terrain), roll 1d8 to see which direction it moves, in a similar manner to determining where a splash weapon lands on a miss. On a 1, the creature moves in its intended direction, with 2 through 8 rotating around the creature&rsquo;s starting square in a clockwise direction. Only the creature&rsquo;s first 5 feet of movement each round are affected in this way&mdash;it can move normally for any remaining movement, either from the same action or from later actions, as the creature acclimatizes to the distortion. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save each round to end the disoriented effect. A creature that leaves the area and re-enters must attempt the saving throw again, even if it succeeded at its initial save.

An <i>incendiary cloud</i> spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a <i><a href="#Fog Cloud">fog cloud</a></i> does.

By concentrating, you can make the cloud move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder&rsquo;s spread thereafter.
</p>

<p>
As with <i>fog cloud</i>, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can&rsquo;t be cast underwater.

You summon an illusory swarm of angry wasps that fills a 10-foot-diameter sphere. You can summon it so that it shares an area with other creatures, and you can move it up to 40 feet each round as a move action. Creatures caught inside the swarm&rsquo;s area of effect cannot use skills that require patience or concentration. Additionally, spellcasters within the area must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 20 + level of spell to be cast) in order to cast spells. On a failed caster level check, the spell is lost. While the buzzing is unpleasant, it is not so loud as to drown out other noises or make communication difficult.

You summon ghostly chains to bind incorporeal creatures. The chains&rsquo; CMB is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence modifier. Roll only once for the entire spell effect and apply the result to all targeted incorporeal creatures.
</p>

<p>
If the chains succeed in grappling an incorporeal creature, the creature takes an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + your key spellcasting ability score modifier and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents can&rsquo;t move without first breaking the grapple. The spell prohibits all other movement unless the creature breaks the grapple first (although dimensional magic and the like still work as normal). Each round you concentrate, the chains continue grappling their current targets (though they don&rsquo;t seek out targets they aren&rsquo;t currently grappling). The <i>incorporeal chains</i> receive a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents the chains are already grappling, but can&rsquo;t move foes or pin foes. Each round the <i>incorporeal chains</i> succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check, they deal an additional amount of damage equal to 1d8 + your key spellcasting ability score modifier. The CMD of <i>incorporeal chains</i>, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB. If you move out of range of any of the grappled creatures, the chains cease grappling those creatures.

This spell summons a bearded devil, causing it to appear where you designate. The area within a 50-foot radius of where the devil appears is ringed with a smoldering, red glow. This area is the testing ground. To successfully cast this spell, no creature other than the devil&rsquo;s challenger; see below can be within this area while the spell is being cast. On the round it appears, the devil identifies itself (typically by name and with a brief recitation of honors) and states it is prepared to do battle with a sole mortal champion. In the same round, either you or a creature you designate while casting the spell must identify the devil&rsquo;s challenger. For the duration of the spell, the devil does everything in its power to kill the challenger. You do not control the devil or have any influence over how it conducts itself in battle, but the devil cannot leave the testing ground. Unlike with <i>summon monster</i> and similar spells, you cannot dismiss the devil. Rather, the conjured devil remains until any one of the following criteria is met: it is reduced below 0 hit points or otherwise defeated, its challenger is slain, its challenger leaves the testing ground, or it takes damage from any source other than its challenger. Upon any of these occurrences, the devil vanishes. Conjuring a devil is typically an evil act. If cast for any purpose besides the administering of a Hellknight test, this spell has the evil descriptor.

<p>
This spell infuses an effigy with a powerful curse that targets a specific type of creature associated in some way with the effigy itself. When you cast this spell, it remains in effect until it is discharged. Once you cast <i>infuse effigy</i>, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it or cast another spell with its spell slot until you dismiss the <i>infuse effigy</i> spell or until it is discharged against a foe. If the number of 4th-level spells that you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of <i>infuse effigy</i> spells, the more recently cast <i>infuse effigy</i> spells in excess of the number of 4th-level spells you can now cast are dispelled.
</p>

<p>
The nature of the curse that becomes infused into the effigy you touch depends more on the nature of the effigy than anything else. You can cast this spell on a standard effigy (such as a head stuck onto a spike, or on a body hanging from a tree), but can generate more powerful effects by casting the spell on one of the more elaborate effigies detailed above&mdash;in this case, it is the established traditions of the effigy as much as the effigy itself that empowers the curse. The larger effigies, such as the tree of souls and the wicker man, have minimum caster level requirements; you must be this level or higher in order to cast <i>infuse effigy</i> on such a target.
</p>

<p>
Once an effigy is infused, it radiates an aura of unease to a radius of 5 feet per caster level&mdash;the first time a creature enters this area, it must make a Will save or become shaken for 1 minute per caster level. This effect can only occur once per creature and is a mind-affecting fear effect. As long as an effigy remains under the effects of this spell, the body parts associated with the effigy become preserved as if by <i><a href="#Gentle Repose">gentle repose</a></i>. Once an effigy has been the focus for an <i>infuse effigy</i> spell, it can never again be the target of this spell&mdash;a new effigy must be constructed from new victims if you wish to recreate it. An infused effigy is treated as a magic item for the purposes of saving throws.
</p>

<p>
An infused effigy has an additional effect on creatures of the same type as the largest creature incorporated into the effigy. If the largest creature is a humanoid or outsider, the additional effect only affects creatures of the largest creature&rsquo;s subtype. Creatures of this type (and subtype) take a &minus;2 penalty on the saving throw against the effigy&rsquo;s aura, and as soon as such creatures attack or damage the effigy (from any distance) or approach within 10 feet of it, they must make a Will saving throw or become cursed. If a creature becomes cursed by an infused effigy, the spell effect on the effigy ends (and the caster can now use that spell slot to prepare or cast spells again), but the curse itself is permanent until it is removed. If the creature that triggers the effigy was close friends with or related to anyone whose body was used to construct the effigy, that creature takes a &minus;4 penalty on the Will save to avoid becoming cursed. The specific effects of each type of effigy&rsquo;s curse are listed below. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, other specific effigies might exist, along with specific effects they exhibit when they are the subject of an <i>infuse effigy</i> spell.

If the targeted robot fails its Will saving throw, it transforms into a magical construct made of wood, stone, flesh, or bone. The robot&rsquo;s statistics and abilities do not change, although it is now a magical construct rather than a technological one. It loses the robot subtype, but does not lose its Intelligence score (if any). You can issue mental commands to the infused robot as long as it stays within range of the spell; issuing commands in this manner is a free action for you. When the spell&rsquo;s duration runs out, the robot transforms back to normal but is staggered for 1d4 rounds.

You create one or more vibrant pillars of kaleidoscopic color that rise out from the ground. A creature attempting to move through one of the pillars must attempt a Will save. Failure means the creature can&rsquo;t move through the pillar and can&rsquo;t take any other actions for the duration of its turn that round, but it can attempt to pass through the pillar again in subsequent rounds (attempting another save against the effect). A creature need only succeed at one saving throw to move through all pillars created by this spell.

A creature standing within the area of a pillar is dazzled (no save), while a creature making a ranged attack that passes through one or more of the illusory pillars takes a 50% miss chance. A creature can make a melee attack against a target within a pillar at no penalty.

Any creature that interacts with the target of this spell must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the DC of the spell) or view the target in the most innocuous possible light. On a failed saving throw, the creature views all of the target&rsquo;s actions as inoffensive and no cause for concern unless the target becomes an obvious threat. The creature can otherwise act normally, and feels no compunction to obey or ignore the target; it simply assumes none of the target&rsquo;s actions are dangerous or malicious unless shown evidence that proves otherwise.

A favorite in the creaking courts of Ustalav, <i>insect scouts</i> summons one or more vermin to investigate a single location or building you can see. Your scouts must spend 1d6 hours investigating the target location, but need no oversight. When done, they return unerringly to you with their findings, traveling up to 1 mile per caster level you have to rejoin their master. Each insect&rsquo;s size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + &frac12; your caster level, and can&rsquo;t attack. Because of their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can attempt Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + &frac12; your caster level.
</p>

<p>
Each scout that returns passes along memories of specific structural flaws, defenses, and alarms, granting you the ability to reroll one failed skill check per scout, as long as the skill check involves that specific location&rsquo;s layout, such as a Stealth check to sneak in, a Disable Device check to silence an alarm, or a Perception check to notice a trap. If even one scout returns, you also gain a rough understanding of the building&rsquo;s layout (at least, any portions your scouts could access). All insight (and the associated rerolls) fades 1 hour per caster level you have after the scouts return. Your insects remember nothing about creatures, and so provide no information about guardians or any conversations they may overhear.

You summon one or more glossy black beetles, which have a measure of intelligence and make for excellent spies. When they are in your presence, the insects obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them as a single standard action, provided that you issue the same orders to each one. In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can&rsquo;t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone&rsquo;s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.
</p>

<p>
Each insects&rsquo; size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + &frac12; your caster level, and can&rsquo;t make attacks. Due to their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can make Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + &frac12; your caster level. The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a +16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being climbed is, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of +0 for Huge or larger creatures).
</p>

<p>
You also maintain a faint mystical connection with these insects, which allows you to sense where they are. As a full-round action, you can concentrate on the spell in order to learn the direction and relative distance of each of the insects.

You can heal a creature, harm an undead creature, or call upon a very recently dead creature to fight beyond death&rsquo;s reach. The target creature regains 1d8 hit points per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8).

<p>
This healing can even bring back to life creatures that have been dead within the previous 1 round (but they cannot have been dead for any longer). If you apply this spell&rsquo;s healing to such a creature and its hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If you awaken a dead creature in this way, all allies of that creature within 60 feet who can see it regain consciousness gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for 1 minute thereafter, as the healing powers of your deity have imbued them with renewed vigor.

You create an illusory duplicate of the target item. If you hold the charge on this spell, you can deliver it while touching an object you steal with Sleight of Hand or a steal combat maneuver; in this case, the illusion phases into existence exactly as you remove the genuine article, allowing you to instantaneously replace a protected or guarded item with no change in appearance, weight, or other factors.
</p>

<p>
The illusion appears to be a perfect replica. Actively examining the fake with an Appraise or Perception check grants a creature a Will save, but on a failed saving throw, it concludes that the fake is the genuine article. The illusion isn&rsquo;t a functional item, nor does it have any magical properties of the original. For example, an <i>instant fake</i> of a set of thieves&rsquo; tools can&rsquo;t be used to pick a lock, a false warhammer can&rsquo;t harm a person or break an object, a suit of unreal chainmail offers no actual protection, and an illusory <i>potion of cure light wounds</i> doesn&rsquo;t heal any hit points when imbibed.

You touch a surface and produce a painted portrait of either yourself or a creature you can see without needing to attempt a Craft (painting) check. The surface to be affected must be relatively flat, such as a piece of paper or a wall. The image can be any color of your choice, but is monochromatic. While it is of too poor a quality to sell, it is otherwise accurate enough to recognize the subject or to serve as a target for the <i>enter image</i> spell. The portrait reflects your perception of the creature depicted, including any disguises, magical or mundane, that the subject is wearing at the time of the painting&rsquo;s creation. The portrait is only as durable as normal paint and can be removed by mundane means.

<p>
<i>Instant restoration</i> channels planar energy into a summoned creature. This spell can be cast as an immediate action when a summoned creature you control drops to 0 or fewer hit points. Rather than immediately disappear, the creature is healed for 4d8 hp + 1 hit point per caster level (maximum 4d8+10 hit points). If this healing brings your summoned creature&rsquo;s hit point total to 1 or more hit points, it remains as if its hit points had never dropped to 0 or fewer. Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by <i>instant restoration</i>. A summoner can target his eidolon with this spell.

You call some nonliving item directly to your hand from virtually any location.
</p>

<p>
First, you must place your <i>arcane mark</i> on the item. Then you cast this spell, which magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.
</p>

<p>
If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but you know who the possessor is and roughly where that creature is located when the summons occurs.
</p>

<p>
The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a <i>read magic</i> spell, to anyone but you.
</p>

<p>
The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Instant Summons">instant summons</a></i>, except that you can target multiple objects. You must use a separate sapphire worth 1,000 gp for each one. For each item you target, you can touch a creature, granting that creature the ability to speak the special word for that item (each item has its own special word) while crushing the matched gem to call the item to hand.

<p>
You begin a psychic duel with a creature. This psychic duel takes place on a binary mindscape that includes only two minds: yours and the target&rsquo;s. This spell ends and both minds return to their respective bodies if one of you drops below 0 hit points or if both of you agree to end the psychic duel (a free action that you can perform even if it isn&rsquo;t your turn).
</p>

<p>
Even if you cast the spell, you must succeed at a Will save to escape your own psychic duel if your opponent doesn&rsquo;t want to allow you to leave. Spells like <i>mindscape door</i> can also free you from the mindscape (and <i>mindscape door</i> is one of the few spells you can cast in a binary mindscape). A binary mindscape is clearly illusory, and disbelieving the illusion doesn&rsquo;t alter how the mindscape works.

You cause a weapon to exude a palpable aura of divine fury. While wielding this weapon, a creature gains a +2 morale bonus on Intimidate checks. When an attack made using the targeted weapon hits, the wielder can spend a free action to discharge the effect to inflict agony on the creature the weapon hit. If that creature has spell resistance, it applies against this effect. If the creature fails a Will save, it is nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. If it succeeds at the saving throw, the creature is instead sickened for 1 round. The sickened condition created by the instrument is a mind-affecting effect.

<i>Interposing hand</i> creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand&mdash;it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.
</p>

<p>
An <i>interposing hand</i> is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you&rsquo;re undamaged, and is AC 20 (&minus;1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don&rsquo;t cause damage do not affect it.
</p>

<p>
The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents.
</p>

<p>
It cannot push through a <i>wall of force or</i> enter an <i>antimagic field</i>, but it suffers the full effect of a <i>prismatic wall</i> or <i>prismatic sphere.</i> The hand makes saving throws as its caster.
</p>

<p>
<i>Disintegrate</i> or a successful <i>dispel magic</i> destroys it.
</p>

<p>
Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature&rsquo;s attacks.
</p>

<p>
Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

The body of the target creature gains a metabolic response that allows it to benefit from normally deadly toxins. When a poison would cause ability damage to the target creature, the target instead gains a +4 alchemical bonus to that ability score. The spell then immediately ends, but the bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of ability damage the poison would have caused. If the poison would deal more than one type of ability damage, each bonus has a separate duration. If the poison has effects other than ability damage (such as unconsciousness or ability drain), these effects apply normally. This spell affects only a single poison; if multiple poisons affect the target simultaneously, this spell prevents only ability damage and grants the appropriate bonuses for the poison that would cause the most damage.

<p>
The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
</p>

<p>
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character&rsquo;s perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.
</p>

<p>
Spells such as <i>bless</i> that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.
</p>

<p>
<i>Invisibility</i> can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

<p>
A glamered bubble surrounds the target&rsquo;s space, rendering her completely invisible underwater by hiding both the target and any water she displaces. Because of the bubble&rsquo;s size limit, this spell works only on Medium or smaller targets. Other objects and creatures within the bubble&rsquo;s space are also invisible while they stay in the space, which could reveal the spell&rsquo;s existence to a canny observer who notices fish disappearing into the bubble and reappearing on the other side. Creatures inside the bubble can see each other, which allows foes who can pinpoint the bubble&rsquo;s location (such as dragons) to stick their heads into the bubble in order to see the target. Any creature on the inside of the bubble that takes any action that would break <i><a href="#Invisibility">invisibility</a></i> pops the bubble and ends the spell early. On land, the bubble is clearly visible, acting much as <i>invisibility</i> does in the water. Unlike with <i>invisibility</i>, the inside of the bubble blocks light from escaping the bubble, meaning that light sources inside the bubble don&rsquo;t illuminate past its edges, but also don&rsquo;t reveal a telltale glow.

By holding aloft a holy symbol and calling your deity&rsquo;s name, you take on an aspect of that divinity. When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain&rsquo;s benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell&rsquo;s DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round&mdash;this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell&rsquo;s duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end.

You must worship a single divinity in order to cast this spell, even if you do not normally cast divine spells. If you perform an action that blatantly violates your deity&rsquo;s precepts while under this spell&rsquo;s effects, <i>invoke deity</i> immediately ends and you are stunned for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. <i>Invoke deity</i> has the same alignment descriptors (&#91;chaotic&#93;, &#91;evil&#93;, &#91;good&#93;, or &#91;lawful&#93;) as your deity&rsquo;s alignment. If an ability duplicates a spell, it functions as that spell heightened to a level equal to your <i>invoke deity</i> spell.

This spell must be cast as you activate wild shape to assume the form of an animal of at least Large size. When you assume the animal form, it takes on many of the primal characteristics of the savage, prehistoric creatures that dwell in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. When this spell&rsquo;s duration expires, you return to your natural form automatically&mdash;in effect, you shorten the duration of that use of wild shape to the duration of this spell when you cast <i>invoke primal power</i>. In addition to the normal effects you gain upon assuming the wild shape, you also gain a +4 size bonus to your Constitution score and increase the natural armor bonus granted by the effect by 2 (thus, if you assume the size of a Large animal as if via <i>beast shape II</i>, your natural armor bonus is +6 instead of +4). Furthermore, you gain one of the following additional abilities while you are in your enhanced wild shape form. At caster level 13th, you gain two of the following abilities, and at caster level 17th, you gain three of the abilities.

This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities. You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire.
</p>

<p>
However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.
</p>

<p>
You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a &minus;6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 35% and a &minus;6 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can&rsquo;t use potions) or play wind instruments.
</p>

<p>
Your unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.
</p>

<p>
Your weight increases by a factor of 10, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the lack of air at the bottom of the ocean&mdash;at least until the spell duration expires.

<p>
You launch an ingot of iron at the target. If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, the target&rsquo;s skeleton or exoskeleton turns into jagged shards of cold iron. Whenever the target moves, it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and is sickened for 1 round as metal spines stab into its flesh. This damage is subject to damage reduction, but it overcomes damage reduction as though it were a weapon of cold iron and magic. A creature affected by this spell can choose to remain motionless to avoid taking damage. Creatures with DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron and magic affected by this spell are nauseated instead of sickened. This spell has no effect on a creature that has neither a skeleton nor a hard carapace.

This spell creates a 1-foot-long spike of cold iron that you fling at your target as a ranged touch attack. The stake is treated as a magic and cold iron weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, and deals 1d6 points of piercing damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level). Additionally, if a creature with DR/cold iron takes damage from this spell, it is sickened for 1 round and must attempt a Fortitude save. If it fails, for a number of rounds equal to your caster level, it must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to any normally required concentration checks) to use any spells or spell-like abilities it has&mdash;the DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell&rsquo;s level. If the creature fails this concentration check, its spell is wasted.

This spell causes a brushy beard of stiff iron to erupt from the face of a willing target. The <i>ironbeard</i> grants a +1 armor bonus to AC, and this bonus stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The <i>ironbeard</i> may also be used as a weapon equivalent to cold iron armor spikes. The <i>ironbeard</i> makes it difficult to speak, so any spellcasting with a verbal component has a 20% spell failure chance.

Your skin hardens and takes on the color and texture of rough iron.

<i>Ironwood</i> is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, <i>ironwood</i> is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on <i>ironwood</i>. Spells that affect wood do affect <i>ironwood</i>, although <i>ironwood</i> does not burn. Using this spell with <i>wood shape</i> or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.
</p>

<p>
Further, if you make only half as much <i>ironwood</i> as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.

The spell&rsquo;s area of effect floods with dangerous radiation. The strength of the radiation you create depends on your caster level, as detailed below. The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally per the rules for radiation areas of effect. Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The save to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell, not the standard save DC for radiation.

This spell lets you look into a mirror near you and see an image that is reflected in another specific mirror (chosen by you) or an individual reflected in any other mirror. This works like a <i><a href="#Scrying">scrying</a></i> spell, except you can only view creatures on the same plane as you. Each time you cast the spell, you can choose to see one of three types of reflections in your mirror.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Known Mirror:
	<td>	The current reflection in another mirror with which you are familiar.
<tr>
	<th>	Known Person:
	<td>	The current reflection of a person you know well, assuming that person is near a mirror.
<tr>
	<th>	Known Place:
	<td>	The current reflection of a place you know well, assuming the location is being reflected in a mirror.
</table>

<p>
You receive only visual information through this ability. You can choose to transmit information both ways so that a person reflected in the remote mirror can view whatever appears in the mirror you are using.
</p>

<p>
For example, Urion Petresky knows that Queen Elvanna keeps a mirror in a hall near her throne room. He can look through his own handheld mirror and see into this hall, even if the queen is not there. Alternatively, he can attempt to find the queen (wherever she is) by looking into his mirror; if, at that moment, the queen is near any mirror at all, he can see her. He may instead cast the spell and try to see into her throne room, hoping that someone has brought a mirror there. If any of these conditions fails, Urion sees nothing but his own reflection.
</p>

<p>
This spell works with intentionally fabricated mirrors only; it is not effective with other reflective surfaces, such as still pools or polished metal shields. Effects that block <i>scrying</i> block this spell.

The scholars of the Magaambya claim that Old-Mage Jatembe developed this spell to help eradicate the lost city of Ird, although such claims have never been confirmed. This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to swell into Gargantuan vines and tendrils that erupt from the ground, reaching for any structure or any creature of evil alignment, functioning like <i><a href="#Black Tentacles">black tentacles</a></i> except as noted. When you are determining the tendrils&rsquo; CMB, the tendrils use your caster level as their base attack bonus and have a +13 bonus due to their Strength. Any tendril that succeeds in grappling a foe deals 4d6+13 points of damage to the grappled creature. Additionally, the tendrils created by this spell can detect evil auras, as if they had spent 3 rounds observing all creatures and objects within the spell&rsquo;s area using <i><a href="#Detect Evil">detect evil</a></i>, and attack and impede the movement of only evil creatures, though they also attack any structures in their area. Each structure suffers a single attack each round; your caster level acts as the base attack bonus for these attacks, and the tendrils deal 4d6+13 points of damage on each successful attack. Creatures that lack evil auras are not attacked or impeded by this spell.

You fill the target with a sense of entitled self-importance, making the subject unable to bear the indignity of another creature getting something that it doesn&rsquo;t have. Whenever an ally of the target receives a harmless spell or spell-like ability, beneficial supernatural effect, or assisting action (including the aid another action, first aid using the Heal skill, etc.) that doesn&rsquo;t also include the target, the target is driven into a murderous rage against either the producer of that effect or the nearest creature that benefited from that effect, whichever is closer. The target must attack that creature on its next turn. Any ability that deals lethal damage is considered an attack for this purpose. Once the target deals lethal damage to the object of his <i>jealous rage</i>, the compulsion to attack that creature ends.

The creature you designate is surrounded by a glowing red aura of vengeful fate. Once per round when the target makes an attack or casts a spell, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC = 10 + &frac12; caster level + Charisma (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom (in the case of clerics). If the target fails the saving throw, it takes 4d6 + your Charisma modifier (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom modifier (in the case of clerics) electricity damage. It takes no damage on a successful saving throw. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when its subject confirms a critical hit to negate the critical hit and daze the creature for 1 round. The attack still hits its target and deals normal damage. The effects of the daze occur after the attack.

<p>
This powerful, elaborate, and risky spell undoes Pharasma&rsquo;s judgment, returning a willing petitioner to its mortal life. This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell&rsquo;s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.
</p>

<p>
The casting of <i>judgment undone</i> is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell&rsquo;s 10-minute casting time, an olethros appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless <i>judgment undone</i> has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment&mdash;how successful she may be depends on the GM&rsquo;s discretion.
</p>

<p>
The caster of <i>judgment undone</i> can pause the spell&rsquo;s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on <i>judgment undone</i> and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to cast <i>judgment undone</i> without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM&rsquo;s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast <i>judgment undone</i> is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it&rsquo;s not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell&rsquo;s casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell&rsquo;s material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma&rsquo;s code of conduct.

You merge your mind into the jungle&rsquo;s social hierarchy, mystically establishing yourself as a master of wild beasts and an apex predator. You attain knowledge about the general animal population in a radius of 1 mile as <i><a href="#Commune with Nature">commune with nature</a></i>, and you then select one type of animal (such as birds, cats, snakes, or fish). For the duration of the spell, you can sense the location, movement, and size of creatures of this type in the area, though you can&rsquo;t discern species or individual identity. In addition, you improve the starting attitude of animals of the chosen type by one step for the duration of the spell.
</p>

<p>
As a full-round action, you may focus on a single animal that you can sense with this spell to establish a mental link. You can read the animal&rsquo;s surface thoughts as <i><a href="#Detect Thoughts">detect thoughts</a></i>, and can see, hear, and smell what the animal is experiencing using your own Perception skill. If you target another creature&rsquo;s animal companion, the spell ends if the animal succeeds at a Will save. Using this ability reduces the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration to 1 round/level, and the selected animal is treated as the scrying sensor.

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19&ndash;20, a threat range of 19&ndash;20 becomes 17&ndash;20, and a threat range of 18&ndash;20 becomes 15&ndash;20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the <i>keen edge</i> on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.
</p>

<p>
Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.
</p>

<p>
Multiple effects that increase a weapon&rsquo;s threat range (such as the <i>keen</i> special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don&rsquo;t stack. You can&rsquo;t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

This spell enables the subjects to stand watch or keep vigil throughout the night without any ill effects. The subjects suffer no fatigue and gain all the usual benefits of a full night&rsquo;s rest. The subjects gain hit points as though from resting, wizards may prepare their spells as though they had slept for 8 hours, and so on. Effects that rely on actual sleep or dreaming are ineffective, though the subjects are still susceptible to effects that would put them to sleep, such as <i>sleep</i> or <i>deep slumber</i>. Any vigorous activity, including fighting, immediately ends the effect, and the affected creatures must either have the spell cast on them again or sleep for the remaining hours to avoid fatigue and gain the benefits of a full night&rsquo;s rest.

<p>
By touching a single door, gate, or other portal, you create a keyhole where none existed before or double the size of an existing keyhole. A conjured keyhole allows you to peer through the door, though the limited perspective imposes a &minus;10 penalty on Perception checks to spot anything beyond. It also allows a sealed door to be locked or picked if it could not be before. Locking or unlocking such a door requires a successful Disable Device check with a DC equal to the barrier&rsquo;s break DC + 10. Enlarging an existing keyhole allows viewers to peer through to whatever lies beyond, even if the preexisting keyhole did not allow it, and it reduces the Disable Device DC to open or lock the door by 5.
</p>

<p>
This spell does not normally allow a saving throw, but magic doors and barriers can resist the effect with a successful Will saving throw, as if they were carried by their original creator.

Originally created by the priest-king of Nemret Noktoria, the ghoul Kortash Khain, for use by his minions to bolster their forces in battles against their enemies, Khain&rsquo;s army has become a favorite of many necromancers throughout Osirion and beyond. By scattering a handful of ghoul&rsquo;s teeth across the ground, you cause 1d4+1 ghouls led by a single ghast to rise up from the ground around you. The ghouls and their ghast leader must appear in squares adjacent to you, but after that they follow your spoken commands unerringly.
</p>

<p>
If one of the ghouls is destroyed while the spell&rsquo;s duration is still in effect, it bursts into a spray of rotten flesh and necromantic energy that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage to all adjacent targets&mdash;this energy heals undead targets as typical for negative energy damage. If the ghast is destroyed in this manner, it deals twice as much negative energy damage as a ghoul. A successful Fortitude save halves the negative energy damage dealt. When this spell&rsquo;s duration expires, any remaining undead created by this spell crumble apart into dust and blow away without dealing any additional negative energy damage.

This spell converts the momentum and force from melee attacks made against the target of the spell, reflecting them back upon the attacker&rsquo;s weapon. After making a successful melee attack against the target, an attacker must make a Fortitude saving throw for the weapon used. If the weapon fails the save, it takes damage equal to the damage rolled against the target. Creatures using natural attacks or unarmed strikes are unaffected by this spell.

<p>
This spell&mdash;a favorite of fey spellcasters&mdash;is traditionally bestowed with a kiss, though all that&rsquo;s really required to gift someone with a <i>kiss of the First World</i> is a touch. This spell infuses a living creature with a surge of positive energy from the First World, filling the target with the raw energies of life. The exact effects of this spell vary, depending on the nature of the creature touched. Constructs are immune to the effects of this spell.

You invest a target with cursed elemental energy, causing nearby bodies of water to roil when the target draw nears and tendrils of water to drag it deeper under the waves. The target takes a &minus;10 penalty on Swim checks and automatically sinks 15 feet per round when in any body of liquid.

<i>Knock</i> opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to <i>hold portal</i> or <i>arcane lock</i>. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, <i>knock</i> opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an <i>arcane locked</i> door, the spell does not remove the <i>arcane lock</i> but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. <i>Knock</i> does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.

You impart your knowledge of nobility and peerage to the target, allowing her to recognize members of noble households, differentiate one set of heraldry from another, and otherwise identify who&rsquo;s who at a royal gala or other noteworthy social event. The target is able to identify noble individuals, noble family names, and noble crests, signets, heraldry, and other symbols. The target treats her number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility) as though it were equal to your number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility), to a maximum of 5 ranks and a minimum of 0. If the target&rsquo;s number of ranks is greater than yours, she uses her own number of ranks instead. In addition, if the target&rsquo;s new total skill bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks is at least +0, she automatically succeeds on all Knowledge (nobility) checks with a DC of 10 or lower.

You gain a brief but incomplete understanding of one book&rsquo;s contents, equivalent to having skimmed its pages for 1 hour.

You wrap the target in a mantle of summery air, within which the ambient temperature never falls below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Creatures with the cold subtype that start their turns in the area take an amount of fire damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum 1d4+5) with no saving throw. Each time an evil dragon, fey, or giant takes damage from the spell, it must succeed at a Will saving throw or become shaken for 1 round. Creatures attempting to cast a cold spell in the area must succeed at a Will save or the spell fails. Succeeding at one such save to cast a spell allows a creature to continue casting cold spells in the area for the spell&rsquo;s remainder.

Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract&rsquo;s duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae with the words &ldquo;bomb admixture&rdquo; in their titles) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the those of the new one become active.
</p>

<p>
When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, it affects up to four creatures&mdash;the creature the bomb hit directly, and up to three other creatures damaged by the splash (alchemist&rsquo;s choice). Those creatures must succeed at a Will saving throw or become fatigued.

You greatly extend the time it takes for the poison you touch to take effect, giving that poison an onset time up to 1 hour per caster level. (You touch the poison&rsquo;s container, so you don&rsquo;t risk exposing yourself to a contact poison.) The target doesn&rsquo;t attempt a saving throw when initially exposed to the <i>languid venom</i>, but instead saves at the end of the poison&rsquo;s onset time. If the poison is neutralized or otherwise cured prior to the end of its onset time, it is rendered harmless. Failing saves against multiple doses of <i>languid venom</i> have the normal cumulative effect for poisons.
</p>

<p>
<i>Languid venom</i> is difficult to detect or identify. <i>Detect poison</i> and similar effects detect <i>languid venom</i> only with a successful caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level (rolled secretly by the GM). Even if the poison is detected, the DC of Craft (alchemy) or Wisdom checks to identify the poison is increased by 10. If a poison is affected by an additional effect that requires a caster level check to detect the poison or increases the DC to identify it&mdash;such as <i>obscure poison</i>&mdash;those effects don&rsquo;t stack. Use only the caster level check with the higher DC and increase the DC of the check to identify the poison by the higher of the two.
</p>

<p>
If cast upon a venomous creature, <i>languid venom</i> delays the onset of that creature&rsquo;s poison when the creature next delivers its natural poison.

You draw on the essence of astradaemons to cause one of your hands to elongate and sprout fearsome translucent claws that radiate a cold phosphorescence. You gain one claw attack, which is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of slashing damage on a hit (1d4 for a Small spellcaster) and forces the creature struck to succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell (spell resistance applies) to resist gaining 1 negative level. Each time you inflict a negative level with this spell, you gain 5 temporary hit points that persist for 1 hour. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw against your claw&rsquo;s negative level is immune to further negative levels inflicted from this casting of <i>lash of the astradaemon</i> but not to the claw&rsquo;s damage. The claw does not interfere with your ability to cast spells or perform other actions that require hands. You can use your claw attack up to 1 time per 2 caster levels. Your claw reverts to a normal hand once you&rsquo;ve delivered all of your potential attacks or after 24 hours (whichever comes first).

You create a sword of force that functions as mage&rsquo;s sword except as described here. The sword does not receive the additional +3 enhancement bonus a mage&rsquo;s sword receives, and deals 3d6 points of force damage. You cannot command the sword. Until the sword is triggered, it hovers in your space without interfering with your actions. While hovering in this way, the sword attempts to defend you from incoming attacks, granting you a +4 shield bonus to your AC. The first time a foe within close range damages you or forces you to attempt a saving throw that you fail, the sword is triggered and begins attacking that target as described in mage&rsquo;s sword for the duration of the spell. This ends the shield bonus. You cannot direct the sword to defend against a new target once it has begun to attack. If its target moves beyond the sword&rsquo;s range, the sword returns to you and hovers until the target is again within range. The sword&rsquo;s return does not restore the spell&rsquo;s shield bonus to AC.

You create shackles of force that attach to the target&rsquo;s limbs. You designate an object or location within 30 feet of the target for the shackles to anchor themselves to; this must be the ground, a wall, or a sturdy structure for the anchoring to occur. The target is entangled, and cannot move more than 30 feet from the anchor point of the spell. The shackle itself cannot be attacked (though it can be dispelled), but if the object or area it is attached to is broken, the target is free to move away (though it is still entangled).

<i>Legend lore</i> brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4 &times; 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better <i>legend lore</i> result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better <i>legend lore</i> result next time).
</p>

<p>
During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are &ldquo;legendary,&rdquo; as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

<p>
You call upon the primordial power of ancient megafauna to boost the size of your target. Because of its connection to living creatures of the distant past, the spell does not function on outsiders, undead, and summoned creatures. Your target grows to legendary proportions, increasing in size by one category. The creature&rsquo;s height doubles and its weight increases by a factor of 8. The target gains a +6 size bonus to its Strength score and a +4 size bonus to its Constitution score. It gains a +6 size bonus to its natural armor, and DR 10/adamantine. Its carrying capacity changes to reflect its new size. The creature&rsquo;s equipment and weapons, if any, also increase in size. Any enlarged item that leaves the creature&rsquo;s possession returns to its original size (though thrown weapons and ammunition deal damage at their enlarged size before returning to their true proportions).
</p>

<p>
If insufficient room is available to accommodate the creature&rsquo;s growth, it attains the maximum possible size and can attempt a Strength check (using its increased Strength score) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it. The spell cannot crush a creature by enclosing it.

You temporarily transfer one of your mythic path abilities to another creature, which can use it as if it were part of the creature&rsquo;s own path.

You call out to nearby nature spirits and grant them temporary plant bodies. These creatures are similar to leshys, except they are Tiny and far more simpleminded. The swarm uses the statistics for a rat swarm, except it does not carry a disease or have scent. The leshy swarm has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and is immune to electricity, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep effects, sonic, and stunning.
</p>

<p>
You can direct the leshy swarm to move up to its speed along a path for your choice by spending a standard action to communicate your desires through the spell, or by spending a move action if you can speak to creatures that understand only Druidic and Sylvan. The leshys are confused by their sudden possession of new bodies and assume that nearly any creature you direct them toward is a threat. They attack all creatures within their area except for you and other creatures with the plant type.

<i>Levitate</i> allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action.
</p>

<p>
You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).
</p>

<p>
A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a &minus;1 penalty on attack rolls, the second &minus;2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of &minus;5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &minus;1.

When you cast this spell, you draw the life force from the surrounding land and hurl it at your enemies, dealing 1d6 points of positive energy damage per caster level (to a maximum of 12d6 at 12th level) to any undead creatures in the spell&rsquo;s area. However, doing so blights the land around you in a spread with a radius of 5 feet per caster level you have (to a maximum of 60 feet at 12th level). All vegetation in that area immediately withers and dies. Plant creatures aren&rsquo;t affected.

You surround the touched creatures with a constant and moveable 1-inch shell of tolerable living conditions. This shell enables the subjects to breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making them immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and poisons and spells like <i>cloudkill</i> and <i>stinking cloud</i>. In addition, the shell protects subjects from extremes of temperature (per <i><a href="#Endure Elements">endure elements</a></i>) as well as extremes of pressure.

<p>
<i>Life bubble</i> does not provide protection from negative or positive energy (such as found on the Negative and Positive Energy planes), the ability to see in conditions of poor visibility (such as in smoke or fog), nor the ability to move or act normally in conditions that impede movement (such as underwater).

<p>
The target moves by Stealth whenever possible, and lies and deceives others instinctively to further its personal agenda.

You bind the life forces of the targets into a mystical pact. If any target is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, that target automatically triggers the power of the pact. The triggering target drains 1 hit point from all other targets that have at least 1 hit point and are within 30 feet of the triggering target; these hit points are applied to the triggering target as magical healing. This healing can prevent the triggering creature from dying, if the attack would cause the target to have a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score. This healing cannot raise the triggering creature above 1 hit point; any excess hit points drained from other targets are wasted.
</p>

The pact can be triggered once per round. It&rsquo;s not triggered by death effects or effects that do not deal hit point damage.

This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius from the point touched, and increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.

You must have a free hand when casting the spell and, once you call the lance into being, you cannot switch it to another hand or put it down without prematurely ending the spell. As a standard action while holding a <i>light lance</i>, you can choose not to make an attack and instead hold the lance aloft as a beacon of light and truth, creating an area of bright light with a radius of 90 feet. If you choose to do this for one or more additional rounds the lance also casts a spear of brilliant light up into the sky that grows progressively more visible as it continues to climb toward the heavens. Under cover of night or other darkness, if nothing obstructs the beam, it becomes visible for an additional 2 miles during each round in which you continue to aim your lance skyward (2 miles in the second round, 4 miles in the third round, and so on).

With this spell, you create shafts of blue light that illuminate all undead creatures in the area. Affected undead take a &minus;20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Invisible undead are not made visible by this effect, but the light does make it easy to pinpoint the exact squares in which such undead are located (they still retain the 50% miss chance granted by invisibility).
</p>

<p>
The <i>light of Iomedae</i> increases light levels by one step in a 5-foot radius around an affected undead creature. Once an undead is affected, it remains illuminated as long as remains within the spell&rsquo;s range, even if it leaves the spell&rsquo;s original radius, until the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.
</p>

<p>
Affected undead must also make a Will save when they are first illuminated by the <i>light of Iomedae</i>. Those who fail this save lose all benefits of channel resistance and take a &minus;2 penalty on all saving throws made against positive energy effects.

Rays of light burst forth from your outstretched hand, encircling each target&rsquo;s space with a cage of light. If a target fails its Reflex save, it becomes enclosed in the <i>light prison</i>. A creature enclosed in a <i>light prison</i> can attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally as long as it stays within the <i>light prison</i>. However, if a creature passes through the walls of a <i>light prison</i> enclosing it, it takes 1d6 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round.
</p>

<p>
Creatures do not receive saves to negate these effects. Once a creature passes through the walls of a <i>light prison</i> surrounding it, the effect ends for that creature.

A flutter of subtle, telekinetic force causes your target to drop a single nonmagical carried item weighing no more than 1 pound per caster level, such as a coin purse, a key ring, or a loose object in its pocket. The target must succeed at a Perception check against the spell&rsquo;s save DC to notice the dropped item. You select what item the target drops as long as you can see both your target and the item you wish to affect. This use of the spell can&rsquo;t cause a target to lose a held item or anything it is wearing, including jewelry.
</p>

<p>
You can instead cast <i>lightfingers</i> to attempt a single disarm or steal combat maneuver, using your caster level instead of your base attack bonus, and using your Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier, whichever is highest, instead of your Strength modifier. This disarm or steal attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity and cannot be affected by feats or other means of altering a combat maneuver&rsquo;s effects. This use of the spell is immediately obvious.

You generate an arc of lightning between two targets. The lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to both targets and any creatures in a line connecting them. The spell fails if there is no line of effect between the targets. <i>Lightning arc</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path.

You become capable of absorbing electricity with your body. For the duration, you absorb all electricity damage dealt to you until you have stored a total of 18 points of damage. Any excess damage affects you as normally. The energy remains stored until it is expended or the spell expires.
</p>

<p>
If you have at least 6 points of damage stored, you can expend all the energy stored in you as a swift action, charging your hand or a metal weapon in your hand. As a standard action while your hand is charged, you can make a melee touch attack that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity, or you can shoot the energy as a ray with a range of 30 feet. If the attack hits, you deal 1d6 points of electricity damage for every 6 points stored and the energy is expended (any remaining points are wasted). A weapon charged with this energy deals the damage as extra damage the first time you score a hit with the weapon. If your hand or weapon is still charged at the end of your turn, or if the charged weapon leaves your hand before the end of the turn, the energy dissipates harmlessly.
</p>

<p>
Once you have spent the absorbed energy, or if the absorbed energy dissipates, you can absorb more electricity damage. The maximum amount of damage you can store in your body at a time increases by 6 points for every 2 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of 60 points of damage at 19th level).

If the attack is successful, it deals 1d6 points of electricity damage and 1d6 points of damage from divine power (similar to <i><a href="#Flame Strike">flame strike</a></i>), and allows you to attempt a trip combat maneuver check as a free action against your target (using your caster level as your CMB).

Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract&rsquo;s duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae with the word &ldquo;bomb admixture&rdquo; in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and those of the new one become active.
</p>

<p>
When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, lashes of electrical energy are released from the bomb, coalescing on the bomb&rsquo;s direct target and up to three creatures that take damage from the bomb&rsquo;s splash (alchemist&rsquo;s choice). Those affected by the electricity must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 points of electrical damage each time they take a move action to move more than 5 feet for the duration of the effect. This effect does not ignore spell resistance.

Your every footstep creates aquatic plants capable of supporting your weight and that of any creature of your size or smaller that is following you. These lily pads only appear when you cross water or other liquids which do not immediately destroy plants. You can walk across these liquid surfaces without any fear of stumbling (though if knocked prone, dragged under, or otherwise pulled off your feet you still sink in the liquid). For the duration of the spell, any creature of your size or smaller can attempt to follow you by making a DC 10 Acrobatics check every round. Each such check allows it to move at half its normal land speed. If the creature takes a &minus;5 penalty on its check it can move at its normal speed.
</p>

<p>
If a creature fails an Acrobatics check, or if a creature that&rsquo;s larger than you attempts to follow, it falls through, damaging the plants. Each time a creature falls through, all subsequent creatures take a cumulative &minus;5 penalty on their Acrobatics checks when traveling across that particular stretch of plants.
</p>

<p>
As you move, the lily pads disappear behind you once you pass beyond the spell&rsquo;s range. Otherwise, they remain until the spell&rsquo;s duration expires.

A <i>limited wish</i> lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a <i>limited wish</i> can do any of the following things.
<ul>
	<li>	Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
	<li>	Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
	<li>	Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
	<li>	Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
	<li>	Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as <i>geas/quest</i> or <i>insanity</i>.
	<li>	Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a &minus;7 penalty on its next saving throw.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a <i>limited wish</i> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).

You create a dark whip-shaped field of energy that wraps around an enemy&rsquo;s neck, leaving everything except his head paralyzed until you let go of the whip or it is destroyed. You must make a ranged touch attack with this spell. If you strike your target, he takes a 1d6 penalty to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution each round.
</p>

<p>
This penalty cannot reduce any attribute to less than 1, and once any of these attributes reaches 1 the target collapses and his body, except his head, becomes paralyzed. While paralyzed in this way, the target retains full use of his senses, including the ability to feel pain, and can speak (including casting spells with only verbal components). The whip has a maximum length of 20 feet, 15 hit points, and a hardness of 5. The spell ends immediately if you let go of the whip or it is destroyed. When the spell ends, all penalties the target took from this spell also end.

A rare spell without verbal components, <i>lipstitch</i> sews the target&rsquo;s lips tightly together if it fails a saving throw, such that no clear speech, bite attacks, spellcasting, or use of command words is possible. The target takes 1d6 points of damage as the stitches weave through flesh. The victim can still make enough noise to be heard at a distance with a DC 10 Perception check.
</p>

<p>
The thread created by <i>lipstitch</i> can be burst with a DC 20 Strength check as a standard action or can be sliced open with a piercing or slashing weapon (wielded by the target or an ally) as a full-round action. Cutting the thread provokes attacks of opportunity, while making a Strength check does not. Either option causes 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of bleed damage. The target has a 20% chance of failing to cast spells with verbal components until the bleeding is stopped. The effects of multiple castings of this spell do not stack. Optionally, the thread can be removed more carefully over the course of a minute with a DC 20 Heal check. If the check fails, the target takes damage and bleeds as described above. If the check succeeds, the stitches are removed with no harm. Creatures with no mouths are unaffected by <i>lipstitch</i>. Creatures with multiple mouths lose the use of only one mouth per casting&mdash;the particular mouth is chosen by the caster.

The object you target becomes a liquid version of itself and drips or runs like a thin oil until it pools on any flat surface. If the item has magical or alchemical properties, they become inert for the duration of the spell. If you are holding the item when you cast this spell, you can drain it into the bottle used as focus for the spell. Items with hit point damage or the broken condition regain 5 hit points/caster level if drained into a bottle in this way. The duration of temporary effects (such as applied poison or <i>greater magic weapon</i>) passes normally and may expire while the object is in liquid form. The liquid is clearly unsafe to drink, but if, for some reason, a creature does drink the liquid and the spell ends, the creature takes 3d6 points of damage, and brings up the solid version of the item as a standard action in a coughing fit.
</p>

<p>
Any spell or effect that would disperse or dilute an object affected by <i>liquefy</i> forces the object to attempt a Fortitude save (using the effect&rsquo;s DC, or DC 15 for effects with no saving throws of their own, such as pouring a liquefied object into a stream). A failed save causes the object to gain the broken condition. If the item is already broken, it is instead destroyed on a failed save. <i>Liquefy</i> has no effect on artifacts, constructs, or intelligent magic items.

Each functions like <i><a href="#Sepia Snake Sigil">sepia snake sigil</a></i> (and counts as that spell for the purpose of combining other spells that hide or garble text), except instead of trapping the subject, the triggered sigil&rsquo;s effect depends on this spell&rsquo;s school.

By shouting a forceful litany of strictures, you make a chaotic creature more susceptible to the attacks of lawful creatures. If the target is chaotic, it takes double the normal damage from attacks made by creatures that have a lawful aura from a class feature or by creatures that have the lawful subtype. If the target also has the chaotic subtype, when it is hit with attacks made by creatures with a lawful aura, it is also sickened for 1 round. If this spell targets a nonchaotic creature (or one that lacks the chaotic subtype), it has no effect and the spell is wasted.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Locate Object">locate object</a></i>, except this spell locates a known creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.
</p>

<p>
The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.
</p>

<p>
Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by <i>mislead</i>, <i>nondetection</i>, and <i>polymorph</i> spells.

You sense the direction of the nearest <i>teleportation circle</i> (permanent or with a remaining duration), <i>gate</i> spell, or other effect which magically connects two different locations (for example, an active magic item, a creature&rsquo;s special ability, or unique adventure location). <i>Locate gate</i> detects only spells or effects with a permanent or ongoing duration, not instantaneous effects like <i>dimension door</i> or <i>teleport</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Locate gate</i> can be blocked by spells like <i>nondetection</i>, if the effect originates from a specific object or creature. However, spell effects can&rsquo;t likewise be warded. For example, ring gates are a specific object, but a permanent <i>teleportation circle</i> is not (the surface in which it&rsquo;s inscribed doesn&rsquo;t count). <i>Locate gate</i> isn&rsquo;t blocked by lead, water, or other physical environmental conditions, but it is blocked by any intervening area that is dimensionally warded (such as by <i>dimensional lock</i> or <i>forbiddance</i>).

When this spell is active, you feel a mental pull in the direction of any active or operable portal leading to another plane within range of the spell. If multiple portals are present, you are pulled only to the nearest one. If moving causes you to become closer to a different portal, you become drawn to that one instead. The spell gives you the direction of the portal only, not a route. Once you are within 10 feet of the portal, you no longer feel the pull, only the portal&rsquo;s presence. The spell does not pinpoint or otherwise reveal hidden portals, nor does it do anything to aid in opening or operating them.

You inflict a powerful curse on a touched creature that causes others to quickly forget positive aspects of their interactions with the target. The target cannot attempt a Diplomacy (or wild empathy or similar ability) check to improve the attitude of other creatures. Any creature that normally has an attitude of friendly or helpful toward the target must succeed at a Will save at the spell&rsquo;s normal saving throw DC each time it interacts with the target, or its attitude becomes indifferent. Once this curse is removed, creatures coming back into contact with the target regain their pleasant memories of it.

Creatures in the area of this spell are subject to a subtle enchantment that confounds their senses of direction, interferes with recognizing landmarks, and causes them to misjudge distances and angles. Creatures that enter the area must succeed at a new Survival check to avoid becoming lost immediately, whether or not they succeed at their saving throws. Those that fail the save take a penalty on such Survival checks equal to double your caster level, treat all squares they enter as difficult terrain for as long as they are in the area and for 1 hour per caster level thereafter, lose the benefit of all effects that allow them to ignore difficult terrain, and take a &minus;4 penalty to Dexterity.

You inspire yourself or a lover to a vengeful rage against a chosen enemy, who must be a creature that has wronged you in some way. If cast on you, the next time you are in combat with that enemy, you gain the benefits of a <i><a href="#Rage">rage</a></i> spell. If cast on a lover, he or she gains the benefits of a <i>rage</i> spell the next time the lover is in combat against your enemy. This variant of the spell must be cast within 1 hour of an intimate encounter with the target. The rage effect lasts 1 round per level. If the creature that triggers the rage effect is one of your lovers or ex-lovers, the benefits granted by the <i>rage</i> spell double. This spell counts as a <i>contingency</i> spell on the target for the purpose of multiple contingent effects.

You summon a swarm of screeching, mischievous monkeys. The swarm understands and obeys your commands and has the statistics of a monkey swarm. Creatures failing a saving throw against the mad monkeys&rsquo; distraction attack are deafened for 1 minute as well as nauseated. The monkeys attempt one disarm or steal combat maneuver each turn as a free action against any creature that begins its turn in the swarm, using your caster level plus your casting ability score bonus (Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for druids; Charisma for bards, sorcerers, and summoners) for its CMB. Recovering an item from the monkeys requires a successful disarm or steal attempt against that CMB + 10. An object stolen by the monkeys takes swarm damage each round the swarm is in possession of the object.

You imitate the mad cacophony created by the awful beings associated with the Outer God, Azathoth. This spell targets only creatures with the ooze type, creatures with the amorphous special ability, and non-bipedal creatures with a special association with the Outer Gods. This music draws the targets&rsquo; attention to the caster, as per the fascinate bardic performance. It affects mindless creatures despite the mindless quality typically granting immunity to mind-affecting effects, though it doesn&rsquo;t ignore any other immunity to mind-affecting effects the creature might have. The caster doesn&rsquo;t have to maintain the effect each round&mdash;the music continues for the duration of the spell. Creatures fascinated by mad sultan&rsquo;s melody become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24 hours after the spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks on any of its targets for any reason (such as an attack).
</p>

<p>
If you have the bardic performance class feature and the fascinate bardic performance, you can choose to use the spell&rsquo;s saving throw DC or a DC equal to 10 + &frac12; your levels in the class that grants you bardic performance + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. If you choose to use the latter DC, each round of the melody costs 1 round of bardic performance and it counts as an active performance for determining how many performances you can have active.
</p>

<p>
This spell takes a toll on the caster. Each time you cast it, you take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity system, you instead take 2d6 points of sanity damage.

The target is transported to a dark and dank prison in some unspecified horrific demiplane, where tentacles writhe around, clawed fingers grab at the creature (though they deal no damage), and harsh, whispering voices speak blasphemies and maddening secrets. At the end of each round within this terrifying oubliette, the target can attempt a Will saving throw in order to escape the prison. The saving throw has a penalty equal to the number of rounds the target has spent in the oubliette (minimum &minus;1 and maximum &minus;5). If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it returns to its former space. If that space is occupied or otherwise unavailable, the target is shunted to the nearest available space. When the target returns from the oubliette, it is confused for a number of rounds equal to the number of rounds of imprisonment (minimum 1), unless it was confined in the oubliette for 10 or more rounds, in which case the target is affected as if it were subject to an <i><a href="#Insanity">insanity</a></i> spell instead.

When you cast this spell, you merge with an adjacent natural stone surface, forming a 5-foot pocket within. If the stone surface does not have enough volume to safely contain a 5-foot sphere of empty space, the spell fails. When created, there is sufficient air within the pocket for up to one Medium creature to survive for the spell&rsquo;s duration, including one additional Tiny or smaller creature, such as a familiar. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, you are immediately expelled into the nearest available open space adjacent to the surface you merged with.

You speak a short message (up to 25 words), and it is immediately transmitted to each target, who hear it as clearly as if you were standing next to them. By default, the spell targets every creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or greater that is within the spell&rsquo;s range, but at your discretion, you can choose to restrict the spell to certain creatures, causing it to either only deliver its message to creatures meeting a certain criteria, or to deliver it to all creatures except those meeting that criteria. The criteria must be something objective and observable. For example, you could cause the mage&rsquo;s decree to reach only creatures of a certain race. You can&rsquo;t choose recipients that rely on unobservable information, such as creatures of a certain alignment or of a particular class.
</p>

<p>
You can&rsquo;t pick and choose individual creatures to target or exclude. While the spell&rsquo;s range defaults to 1 mile per caster level, you can choose to reduce it to a smaller radius, although the spell&rsquo;s area can&rsquo;t be shaped.
</p>

<p>
The nature of the spell prevents the message it carries from having any magical power; the message can&rsquo;t be used to transmit spells or abilities that are conveyed via speech. The message is transmitted in your voice in whatever language you use to speak it, and is not automatically translated. Any steps you take to disguise your voice are just as effective for messages delivered via this spell as they are for your normal speech. Mage&rsquo;s decree isn&rsquo;t a language-dependent spell; all targeted creatures receive the message, but might not understand it if they don&rsquo;t understand the language in which you spoke the message.

All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined.
</p>

<p>
That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the effect as a <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i> spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell.
</p>

<p>
An item in a creature&rsquo;s possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor&rsquo;s Will save bonus, whichever is higher. If an item&rsquo;s saving throw results in a natural 1 on the die, the item is destroyed instead of being suppressed.
</p>

<p>
You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an <i>antimagic field</i>. If the <i>antimagic field</i> survives the <i>disjunction</i>, no items within it are disjoined.
</p>

<p>
You can also use this spell to target a single item. The item gets a Will save at a &minus;5 penalty to avoid being permanently destroyed. Even artifacts are subject to mage&rsquo;s <i>disjunction</i>, though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. If successful, the artifact&rsquo;s power unravels, and it is destroyed (with no save). If an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.

You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.
</p>

<p>
If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature (see <i><a href="#Invisibility">invisibility</a></i>).
</p>

<p>
The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder&rsquo;s turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
</p>

<p>
The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.

You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
</p>

<p>
You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell&rsquo;s effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level.

A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as <i><a href="#Unseen Servant">unseen servant</a></i> spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to <i>detect thoughts</i>.

This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19&ndash;20 and a critical multiplier of &times;2.
</p>

<p>
The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, goes out of your sight, or you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers.
</p>

<p>
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round&rsquo;s target.
</p>

<p>
The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. The sword&rsquo;s AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).
</p>

<p>
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time mage&rsquo;s sword strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

You alter an item&rsquo;s aura so that it registers to <i>detect</i> spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. If the object bearing <i>magic aura</i> has <i>identify</i> cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object&rsquo;s actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save.

If cast on an object, this spell functions as <i><a href="#Magic Aura">magic aura</a></i>, except that if you have identified the unique spellcasting signatures of a specific individual with <i>greater detect magic</i> or a similar spell, you can make the <i>magic aura</i> appear to have been created by that individual. Alternatively, you can simply obscure all identifiers, making it more difficult to determine who cast the spell. In either case, if the object is the subject of a <i>greater detect magic</i> spell, any Spellcraft check made to identify the unique spellcasting identifiers of the aura automatically produce the result you chose unless the observer disbelieves the spell with a successful Will save (as with <i>magic aura</i>, however, <i>detect</i> spells don&rsquo;t grant a save to disbelieve).
</p>

<p>
If cast on a creature, you can make that creature register to <i>detect</i> spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were the subject of any number of spells that you specify, when the spell is cast. Alternatively, you can make the creature register as nonmagical, hiding all spell effects that he is currently affected by from such scrutiny. If you choose to make the creature register as being the subject of one or more spells, you can also alter the unique spellcasting identifiers of those spell auras, in the same fashion as described for objects.
</p>

<p>
If the target is a creature, you can also alter how the creature registers to <i>arcane sight</i>, making the creature appear to have or not have spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether those abilities are arcane, divine, or psychic in nature, and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability they currently have available for use. Similarly, you can alter the way the target appears when viewed with <i>greater detect magic</i>, causing the last spell that he cast to seem to be any spell of your choice.

<p>
All creatures within the area gain the effects of a <i><a href="#Protection from Evil">protection from evil</a></i> spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them.  If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature&rsquo;s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies&rsquo; spell resistance.
</p>

<p>
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against evil</i> can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding</i>, <i>planar binding</i>, and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle&rsquo;s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell&rsquo;s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.
</p>

<p>
A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.  A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, <i>gate</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>shadow walk</i>, <i>teleport</i>, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature&rsquo;s extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle</i>, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.
</p>

<p>
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.  This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
</p>

<p>
A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i><a href="#Dimensional Anchor">dimensional anchor</a></i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&mdash;even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.
</p>

<p>
This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.

<p>
By casting <i>magic jar</i>, you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the <i>magic jar</i>), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <i>magic jar</i>. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body.  The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar</i> must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.
</p>

<p>
While in the <i>magic jar</i>, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)
</p>

<p>
You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.
</p>

<p>
Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature&rsquo;s soul into the <i>magic jar</i> unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar</i>, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.
</p>

<p>
If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host&rsquo;s life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar</i>. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can&rsquo;t choose to activate the body&rsquo;s extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature&rsquo;s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.
</p>

<p>
As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar</i> if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.
</p>

<p>
If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar</i>, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.
</p>

<p>
If the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar</i>, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar</i> returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the <i>magic jar</i> or the host&rsquo;s location.

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can&rsquo;t be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.
</p>

<p>
For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile&mdash;two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature.

<p>
This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. <i>Magic mouth</i> can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
</p>

<p>
The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal <i>darkness</i> does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical <i>darkness</i> or <i>invisibility</i> does. Silent movement or magical <i>silence</i> defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A <i>magic mouth</i> cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.
</p>

<p>
The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6thlevel caster can command a <i>magic mouth</i> to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.
</p>

<p>
<i>Magic mouth</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Beast Shape IV">beast shape IV</a></i> except you can assume the form of only a magical beast of a size between Diminutive and Huge.

<p>
You create a spherical magnetic field that surrounds you to a range of 30 feet and follows you for the duration of the spell.
</p>

<p>
Unattended metal objects in range&mdash;including weapons, armor, and anything made primarily out of metal&mdash;are pulled violently toward you, stopping just short of your space and falling harmlessly to the ground. Objects secured to a nonmetallic fixture remain where they are unless a forceful tug would be enough to detach them. Loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. If the magnetic field would cause a dangerous metal object such as a sword or anvil to intersect a square occupied by a creature, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage as if from an improvised weapon of the object&rsquo;s size (or smaller or larger, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion).
</p>

<p>
A creature in the area wearing metal armor, wielding a metal weapon, or holding a metal object must succeed at a Reflex save or be dragged 5 feet closer to you in a straight line, as if affected by the pull universal monster rule. A creature can drop a metal object it&rsquo;s holding as a free action to avoid the effect if it&rsquo;s not wearing metal armor; a creature being dragged by its shield can loosen it as a move action and drop it as a free action. Creatures made entirely or mostly of metal take a &minus;2 penalty on their Reflex saves. Creatures that fail their saves by 5 or more are pulled an additional 5 feet closer for every increment of 5 by which they failed their saves.

You cause the touched object to vibrate and release sonic energy once per round as a loud, dangerous chime. The sound grows in strength as time passes.

Each round after that, the damage increases by 1d6 and reaches 5 feet farther in all directions. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage for that round only.

Channeling the blasphemy of fiends into your hand, you mark your target with a brief but fundamental corruption, causing its soul to be irretrievably damned should it die within the next minute. If you are lawful evil, souls are sent to Hell. If you are neutral evil, souls are sent to Abaddon. If you are chaotic evil, souls are sent to the Abyss.
</p>

<p>
A target killed while under the effect of this spell cannot be resurrected by normal means. Only a worshiper of a deity or demigod of your alignment can return a soul damned by <i>malediction</i> to life without difficulty. Other spellcasters must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + your caster level) to restore to life a creature slain while under the effects of <i>malediction</i>. <i>Miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> can return the victim of a <i>malediction</i> to life without requiring a caster level check.
</p>

<p>
A soul can also be freed by the efforts of someone bodily going to the appropriate plane, locating the affected soul, and leading it out of the plane, which allows it to go to its intended destination in the afterlife and be resurrected as normal. You can end the effects of your own <i>malediction</i> by casting the spell again and concentrating on a past target. Doing so only frees the past target to go to its rightful place in death; it does not return the target to life.
</p>

<p>
Spells such as <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, and <i>remove curse</i> negate this spell if successfully cast before the target dies.

<p>
You invoke feelings of a driving malicious intent. The target&rsquo;s malice is directed at a second individual as designated by you at the time of casting. Thereafter, the target attempts to slander, abuse, and even plot murder against the target of its spite. This loathing is not overt, and the target&rsquo;s actions against the object of its spite remain subtle and indirect.
</p>

<p>
The enchanted target remains within its financial and ethical means when acting against the second individual, though the malice toward this other person pushes the target to the limit of what it would do to a hated individual.
</p>

<p>
Each day, the target takes 2 points of Wisdom damage as the all-encompassing spite dominates its thoughts. The target can only alleviate the ability damage by acting upon the emotion and performing a spiteful act. Examples of spiteful acts are spiking the target&rsquo;s drink to make it an easier target for thugs, damaging the target&rsquo;s property, starting foul rumors about the target, framing the target for a crime, paying lepers or beggars to accost the target, extorting or blackmailing the target, or arranging for others to physically harm the target.
</p>

<p>
When the spell ends, the target remembers the spiteful behavior, but not the motivation for it.

You surround yourself with a mantle of calm serenity. You take a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells you cast. Any creature affected by a <i>rage</i> effect (barbarian&rsquo;s rage, bloodrager&rsquo;s bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, <i>rage</i> spell, skald&rsquo;s inspired rage raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt a Will saving throw, without the rage effect&rsquo;s bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate).
</p>

If you become affected by a rage effect while this spell is active, this spell immediately ends. If your rage effect comes from a skald&rsquo;s raging song, then it ends only for you, and you cannot regain the effects of the song.

<p>
You wrap your mind in phantasms of crippling doubt that assail any who dare harm you. When a creature within the mantle&rsquo;s radius attacks you or attempts to affect you with a harmful effect, it must succeed at a Will save as these spectres of uncertainty force themselves into its mind. Ongoing effects trigger the mantle only if the creature consciously directs them against you. A given creature need only roll a saving throw against your <i>mantle of doubt</i> at most once per round. If the creature&rsquo;s attack or effect against you was a psychic spell or spell-like ability, that creature&rsquo;s save takes a &minus;4 penalty. A creatures that fails its save against your <i>mantle of doubt</i> is affected for 1d4+1 rounds, during which time it is shaken, cannot flank, and no longer threatens creatures within its reach. In addition, it takes a &minus;2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting effects, which stacks with the penalties for being shaken. If your <i>mantle of doubt</i> affects a creature that is already shaken, that creature&rsquo;s fear level doesn&rsquo;t increase. Instead, mounting doubts stagger the creature for 1 round and deal 1d4 points of Wisdom and Charisma damage to it.
</p>

<p>
Spell resistance applies against assaults from a <i>mantle of doubt</i>, and immunity to fear or mind-affecting effects negates the spell&rsquo;s effects. If you are immune to fear or mind-affecting effects, you can still cast <i>mantle of doubt</i> on yourself.

<p>
You project your soul out of your body and into the body of a willing creature. This possession is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. The target&rsquo;s soul shares its body with you; it is helpless but can still use its senses. You and the target&rsquo;s soul can communicate telepathically as if using a common language.
</p>

<p>
You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and natural attacks (such as a bite or sting). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can&rsquo;t choose to activate the body&rsquo;s extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural abilities.
</p>

<p>
As a standard action, you can return to your own body, ending the spell. While your soul is possessing the target, your body is helpless. If the host body is slain, you return to your own body if it is within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is slain). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.

You cause the touched object to become lighter than air, such that it floats if not weighted down. The object is effectively weightless and, if left unattended, will rise to a number of feet off the ground equal to twice your caster level, and then remain floating at that height. The object can be pushed, dragged, carried, or otherwise moved normally, and it can be carried by the wind if not held or secured. The object is buoyant enough that it can carry an additional weight of up to 10 pounds per caster level with it, potentially allowing it to be used to carry small objects or creatures.

If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, you burn your handprint onto the flesh of a creature, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage. The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. The flesh around the handprint becomes rough and scaly, like the hide of a lizard. It also glows with a green radiance (shedding light as a torch) when brought within 60 feet of you. While the handprint glows, the target takes a &minus;2 penalty to AC against your attacks and on saving throws to resist any spell you cast or spell-like ability you use.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, each day the target remains cursed, more and more of its flesh becomes covered in reptilian scales. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save each day or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage, 1 point of which is Charisma drain instead. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma by this effect is immediately transformed into a small, harmless cave lizard, as the <i><a href="#Baleful Polymorph">baleful polymorph</a></i> spell.

<i>Marks of forbiddance</i> magically brand two creatures, preventing them from committing violence against one another. When you cast this spell choose one enemy and one ally within range. Both targets become branded with the sigil of forbiddance. Until the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, in order for the two targets to attack one another, even with a targeted spell, each attacker must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, that target can attack the other normally.
</p>

<p>
If the save fails, the target can&rsquo;t follow through with the attack and the action is lost. This spell does not prevent the targets from attacking each other with area of effect spells or abilities.

As long as the affected creature is adjacent to you, you can cause the creature&rsquo;s limbs to flail into the path of other attacks against you as an immediate action. This provides partial cover against that attack, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves.

Among the faithful followers of the gods of purity&mdash;whether they be the servants of Desna in Nidal, zealous followers of Milani struggling against Cheliax&rsquo;s government, paladins of Iomedae fighting against the horrors of the Worldwound, or simply those that fight evil the world over-martyr&rsquo;s bargain represents true faith and true sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
You cast this spell as an immediate action when you are subject to a spell or spell-like ability that deals hit point damage, after attack rolls and saving throws have been rolled but before the damage itself is determined. The damage dealt by the spell and any related effects are then delayed for you (and you only) for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.
</p>

<p>
At the end of that time (or immediately if martyr&rsquo;s bargain is dispelled), the delayed damage takes effect on you as it would have at the time it was cast, but is maximized as if affected by the Maximize Spell metamagic feat. Spells and spell-like abilities that were already maximized gain no additional benefit from this spell. Nothing can prevent this delayed damage from affecting you.
</p>

<p>
You can be affected by only one martyr&rsquo;s bargain spell at a time. If you cast this spell while you are already under the effects of a previous martyr&rsquo;s bargain, the previous spell effect ends and you immediately take the damage it had delayed.

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you place the mask used as the focus component on the target&rsquo;s face, after which it adheres tightly to the target for the spell&rsquo;s duration and cannot be removed by physical force. Despite lacking eyes, this mask does not impair its wearer&rsquo;s vision in any way. While in effect, this spell functions like <i>nondetection</i>, except it also foils divination spells that attempt to gather information about the creature, even if they don&rsquo;t target it specifically. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal the wearer&rsquo;s presence, such as <i>see invisibility</i>, the spell works, but the wearer is detected only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check. Likewise, scrying attempts that specifically target the wearer do not work at all unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check. In addition, the DCs of skill checks to learn about the wearer or identify the wearer and its strengths and weaknesses&mdash;including Diplomacy checks to gather information, Perception checks opposed by the target&rsquo;s Disguise checks, and Knowledge checks&mdash;increase by 4. The mask cannot be removed for the duration of the spell, and the fact that the target is wearing the focus mask cannot be hidden in any way from creatures that observe the target.

You animate the target&rsquo;s shadow with semi-living energies drawn from the Shadow Plane, instilling a maddening hunger for its owner&rsquo;s life energy within it. If the target fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Strength damage as a quasi-real shadow manifests in its space and attacks it. This shadow remains attached to the target and moves wherever the target moves.

At the start of each subsequent round, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d4 additional points of Strength damage; a successful save reduces the Strength damage to 1 point.

You unleash a wave of necromantic energy that snuffs out the life force of those in its path. This wave pulses out from you in a line 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. The wave visibly rips the souls from the bodies of those it passes through, which manifest as screaming, transparent versions of the affected creatures. The wave kills every living creature of 17 or fewer HD in the line, starting with the creature closest to you, to a maximum of 1d4 HD of creatures per caster level. No creature of 18 or more HD can be affected. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw or has too many HD, it doesn&rsquo;t count against the HD the spell can kill The wave continues to affect creatures as it rolls away from you until you either run out of HD to affect or reach the limit of the spell&rsquo;s area. If the spell does not kill any creatures, the unreleased necromantic energy violently explodes in the final square of the 60-foot line, dealing 10d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level to any creature in that square with no saving throw. If several creatures occupy the same square, roll randomly to determine which is affected.

After casting master&rsquo;s escape, you can teleport to your summoned creature&rsquo;s space as a swift action, causing your summoned creature to teleport to your former space. If your summoned creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points before you can use this spell&rsquo;s effect, you can teleport to a space that you can see within 30 feet as an immediate action. After using either of these effects, the spell ends. A summoner can target his eidolon with this spell.

You can mold the ephemeral substance of the Outer Planes, mutating one summoned creature that you control to better suit your needs. Select up to two of the following abilities and grant them to the target for the spell&rsquo;s duration: burrow 30 feet, climb 40 feet, constrict, darkvision 90 feet, ferocity, fly 60 feet (average maneuverability), grab, jet, low-light vision, poison, rake, scent, swim 60 feet, trample, trip, or water breathing. Additionally, instead of selecting an ability, you can replace one of the target&rsquo;s primary natural attacks with another natural attack that deals the same amount of damage, such as replacing a Medium target&rsquo;s bite attack (1d6) with a gore attack (1d6). If you choose to alter a creature&rsquo;s natural attacks, all attacks of the chosen type are altered. A summoner can target his eidolon with this spell.

You convert a non-masterwork item into its masterwork equivalent. A normal sword becomes a masterwork sword, a suit of leather armor becomes a masterwork suit of leather armor, a set of thieves&rsquo; tools becomes masterwork thieves&rsquo; tools, and so on. If the target object has no masterwork equivalent, the spell has no effect. You can affect 50 pieces of ammunition as if they were one weapon. You decide if the object&rsquo;s appearance changes to reflect this improved quality.
</p>

<p>
The material component for the spell is magical reagents worth the cost difference between a normal item and the equivalent masterwork item (typically 300 gp for a weapon, 150 gp for armor, or 50 gp for a tool). If an object has multiple masterwork options (such as a double weapon, or a spiked shield that could be made masterwork as a weapon or armor), you choose one option of the object to affect (though you can cast the spell again to affect another option).

You entice the target creatures to become romantically interested in one another. Each creature saves and applies spell resistance separately. Both must be affected for the spell to have an effect. If either creatures has a prior unfriendly or hostile attitude toward the other, it receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw.
</p>

<p>
This spell doesn&rsquo;t override the targets&rsquo; normal sexual preferences or other limitations. If romantic feelings are incompatible for this reason, the creature instead feels an intimate platonic bond with the other.

Using the Path of Numbers, you are able to influence the seemingly random elements in the environment around a creature, reducing that creature&rsquo;s efficacy. Roll 3d8 and choose one of the dice&mdash;this die&rsquo;s result is the penalty <i>mathematical curse</i> imparts. Next, choose either of the two remaining dice; the d20 roll corresponding to that result on the Eight Basic Energies table is the roll the spell&rsquo;s penalty applies to. The result of the final die represents the number of rounds that <i>mathematical curse</i> lasts. A creature can be under the influence of only one <i>mathematical curse</i> at a time. If <i>mathematical curse</i> is cast on a creature already affected by that spell, the new curse replaces the previous one.

This spell creates a rip in reality that plunges into the interspatial vortices that constantly churn with the raw destructive chaos of the Abyss. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the <i>maw of chaos</i> attempts a drag combat maneuver check against every creature within 40 feet, using your caster level plus your primary spellcasting ability modifier in place of a CMB. If a creature is dragged into a <i>maw of chaos</i>, the area erupts in a surge of chaotic energy and the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Only one such eruption can occur per round.
</p>

<p>
Creatures dragged adjacent to the <i>maw of chaos</i> become entangled by the frayed strands of reality being torn apart at the rim of the <i>maw of chaos</i>. Escape requires a successful Escape Artist check or grapple check against a DC equal to 10 plus the spell&rsquo;s save DC. Every creature without the chaotic subtype that ends its turn adjacent to a <i>maw of chaos</i> takes 2 points of damage to each ability score. Creatures with the lawful subtype take double this amount of damage; creatures with the chaotic subtype take no damage.
</p>

<p>
Calling, summoning, and teleportation effects used within 30 feet of the <i>maw of chaos</i> or that cause a creature to appear within 30 feet of a <i>maw of chaos</i> are redirected, causing the creature to arrive adjacent to the <i>maw of chaos</i> rather than at its intended destination. Unattended objects (including dead bodies) adjacent to the <i>maw of chaos</i> are drawn into it and affected as by <i>disintegrate</i> at the beginning of the caster&rsquo;s next turn.

You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn&rsquo;t escape, the <i>maze</i> disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject.
</p>

<p>
On escaping or leaving the <i>maze</i>, the subject reappears where it had been when the <i>maze</i> spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.
</p>

<p>
Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as <i>teleport</i> and <i>dimension door</i>, do not help a creature escape a <i>maze</i> spell, although a <i>plane shift</i> spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.

This spell works like <i><a href="#Maze">maze</a></i>, except the DC of the Intelligence check to escape is 22 and each round a creature remains in the <i>maze</i> a different effect occurs depending on which section of the <i>maze</i> it is in. Roll on the following table each time the creature attempts an Intelligence check to escape the <i>maze</i> to see which part of the <i>maze</i> it wanders through; if a creature doesn&rsquo;t attempt an Intelligence check, it stays in the same section and suffers that section&rsquo;s effects. Any conditions or damage taken persist for the listed duration even if the creature exits the <i>maze</i> before then, but conditions don&rsquo;t stack with themselves.

	<td>	The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become paralyzed by fear and potential torment for 1 round. This is a fear effect. The creature can&rsquo;t attempt to escape the <i>maze</i> while paralyzed, and if it fails three consecutive saving throws against this paralysis, the hellscape delivers a coup de grace, dealing the creature 4d6 points of fire damage. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or die. A creature that survives the coup de grace escapes from the paralysis as well.

	<th>	Oasis of Respite:
	<td>	Whether it appears as a beautiful glade, a perfumed palace, or a literal desert oasis, this section of the <i>maze</i> is supernaturally peaceful, especially in comparison to the rest of the <i>maze</i>. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. The creature can&rsquo;t attempt to escape the <i>maze</i> while fascinated. A creature that fails three consecutive saving throws to this fascination enters a state of lethargy and gives up ever escaping the <i>maze</i>, remaining in this area until the spell ends on its own in 10 minutes (as per <i>maze</i>).

This spell causes your eyes to take on a silvery mirror-like quality, transforming your eyes into metallic-looking orbs that reflect the world you see. Your vision is in no way impaired while this spell is in effect, but you are granted immunity to gaze attacks for the spell&rsquo;s duration. As an immediate action, you can reflect a creature&rsquo;s gaze back on itself, forcing the target of the gaze attack to save against its own gaze weapon or be affected by it. This reflection bypasses the typical immunity creatures with gaze attacks have to their own race&rsquo;s gaze attack, but does not bypass any other resistances or immunities the creature might have. Once you choose to reflect a gaze attack in this manner, the effect of medusa&rsquo;s bane immediately ends.

<i>Meld into stone</i> enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
</p>

<p>
While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone&rsquo;s complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.
</p>

<p>
Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell&rsquo;s duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.
</p>

<p>
The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying. <i>Stone to flesh</i> expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. <i>Stone shape</i> deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. <i>Transmute rock to mud</i> expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, <i>passwall</i> expels you without damage.

<p>
The target gains a perfect memory of the page you used as a focus component. The target can visualize this page as easily as looking at it in person, including minute details visible to close scrutiny by the naked eye. The memory of the page includes text and images, such as a drawing or a map. Someone unfamiliar with the language on the page (or even an illiterate person) could relay what is written simply by copying the shapes of the letters so another person can read them.
</p>

<p>
The maximum number of pages that a particular target can memorize through repeated castings of this spell is equal to the target&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); any attempts beyond this limit have no effect, although the target&rsquo;s memory of a page could be erased (using <i>modify memory</i> or a similar effect) to effectively make room for a different one.
</p>

<p>
A creature that memorizes magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) cannot borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. However, this would allow a wizard to copy a spell into his spellbook so he could prepare the spell from his book (assuming the spell takes up only one page in a spellbook).

Even a broken object remembers what it means to be a functioning whole. You restore a broken object or damaged construct to a functional state, as if it were new and intact.

<p>
Any pieces missing from the object or construct remain missing. Significant missing pieces may prevent proper functioning. If the object uses charges, the object becomes fully charged. A timeworn object becomes fully charged, but doesn&rsquo;t lose the timeworn condition (this spell is one of the few ways a timeworn item can be recharged).

This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to the object. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of an object must be present for this spell to function. Magic items can be repaired by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than that of the object.

This spell does not affect creatures (including constructs). This spell has no effect on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still repair damage done to such items.

You lock access to the target&rsquo;s procedural memories, preventing it from drawing upon its experience and expertise.

Each round at the end of the target&rsquo;s turn, the target can attempt another Will save to end this effect.

You encase the willing subject in a jeweled shell that has the same hardness and hit points as 5 inches of iron (hardness 10, hp 150). For 7 days, the subject enters a state of suspended animation (as per <i><a href="#Temporal Stasis">temporal stasis</a></i>), during which it heals from even the most grievous wounds. Each day, the subject regains 5 hit points per Hit Die it has as well as recovering from 2 points of ability damage or ability drain from any ability score of its choice. After 7 days, the shell crumbles away and the subject emerges, its body&rsquo;s severed limbs, broken bones, and ruined organs regrown (as per regenerate).
</p>

<p>
If the gemstone you use for the component is worth at least 5,000 gp, <i>metabolic molting</i> can bring a target back to life, as long as it has been dead for no more than 1 hour when the spell is cast. When the spell is used on such a creature, the creature comes back to life after 7 days and stabilizes at 0 hit points. A creature brought back to life through <i>metabolic molting</i> gains 1 permanent negative level, or 2 points of Constitution drain if it is 1st level. Like <i>raise dead</i>, this spell can&rsquo;t save creatures slain by death effects.

<p>
<i>Meteor swarm</i> is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to <i>fireball</i> in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.
</p>

<p>
If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and takes a &minus;4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere&rsquo;s fire damage; see below. If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target&rsquo;s space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.
</p>

<p>
Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.

<p>
You compare two similar items and know if they are identical to one another or not. The spell can indicate an identical match, a categorical match, or no match. For instance, blood samples are identical if they are from the same creature. They are categorical if they are from the same species. There is no match if they are from different species, or if one sample is merely stage blood.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can compare dissimilar items and know if they have a potential relationship. For instance, you can compare a creature&rsquo;s tooth against a bite mark and know if that creature could have caused the bite mark.
</p>

<p>
This spell is not infallible&mdash;an identical match can result from comparing items or creatures that are duplicates of one another. For instance, a knife might have an identical match with a stab wound if an identical knife was used to inflict the wound, and twins might have identical blood or tissues.

You plunge the targets&rsquo; minds into a veiled immersive mindscape of your own design. You can affect any number of creatures whose combined total Hit Dice do not exceed 30. A creature of 10 HD or fewer gets no saving throw, one of 11&ndash;15 HD escapes after 10 minutes per level you possess on a successful save, and a creature of 16 HD or more negates the effect on a successful save. Given time, the bodies of creatures whose minds are trapped in a <i>microcosm</i> can die of starvation and thirst without care. Creatures can neither escape from nor enter a <i>microcosm</i>, even via a <i>mindscape door</i>. <i>Microcosm</i> can be ended only by <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>.
</p>

<p>
Creatures inside a <i>microcosm</i> can be affected by mind-affecting effects targeted against their real bodies. However, they perceive them as natural events within their inner mindscape. Multiple creatures affected by the same <i>microcosm</i> can interact with one another within the mindscape.

<i>Mind fog</i> produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the <i>mind fog</i> take a &minus;10 penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves.

This spell causes the target to act as though it&rsquo;s wandering through a maze. While under the effects of the spell, the target can&rsquo;t make attacks or cast spells and must take at least one move action each round to walk in a random direction determined using the guidelines for missed splash weapons. The target must move at its maximum speed during this required movement, though additional move actions after the first can cover shorter distances. If this movement takes the target into a dangerous area, such as through a threatened square or off a ledge, the target receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Walking into a harmless obstacle, such as a wall, ends the target&rsquo;s movement.

You gain access to the subject&rsquo;s memories and knowledge. You can attempt to learn the answer to one question per round. A successful Will save ends the spell. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11 + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the answer you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds by 5 or more, it answers whatever it chooses, and you believe that wrong answer to be true. Your questions are purely telepathic inquiries, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the target don&rsquo;t need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate sensory images in answer to your questions.

This spell is similar to <i><a href="#Possession">possession</a></i>, except you switch minds with the target, so instead of the target&rsquo;s soul sharing its body with yours and being unable to act, the target&rsquo;s mind moves to your body and can control it as if you each had cast <i>possession</i> on the other.

<p>
You speak a short message (up to 10 words per caster level), implanting both it and the identity of the message&rsquo;s intended recipient in the mind of a willing creature. The creature is aware of the message and who the recipient is.
</p>

<p>
Any attempt to speak, write, or otherwise communicate the message to anyone other than its intended recipient causes the target to forget the message for 1d6 minutes. Attempts to read the target&rsquo;s mind (such as with <i>detect thoughts</i>) or to force the target to reveal the message (such as with torture or magical compulsion) likewise cause temporary amnesia regarding the message.
</p>

<p>
The target can communicate the message only to someone it believes is the intended recipient, which means that disguises, illusions, and polymorph effects might fool the target into delivering the message. Once the target communicates the message, the message is permanently erased from the target&rsquo;s memory.

<p>
You or other creatures enter into or escape from a mindscape through an imaginary doorway. This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.
</p>

<p>
When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door&rsquo;s conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a <i>mindscape door</i> to it. If you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can&rsquo;t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a <i>mindscape door</i> within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.
</p>

<p>
When you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you from creating the door if she is within the mindscape. The two doors operate as if you&rsquo;d cast the spell outside a mindscape. You still designate who can use the door from the real world to get into the mindscape, but you can&rsquo;t prevent creatures within the mindscape from exiting to the real world.
</p>

<p>
Typically, a <i>mindscape door</i> operates in both directions, but you can create it as a one-way door if you so choose. Unlike with other spells, you can cast this spell as a full-round action while engaged in a psychic duel. This spell can be used to exit a binary mindscape, but not to enter one. If you successfully cast <i>mindscape door</i> within a veiled mindscape, you learn that you are in a mindscape, but other creatures observing the door don&rsquo;t automatically realize they are.

You charge yourself with violent psychic energy so attacks you make with weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes cause the target to recall pain suffered in the past. Such attacks deal 1d4 points of nonlethal damage in addition to their normal damage, though creatures immune to mind-affecting or pain effects ignore this additional damage. In addition, when you confirm a critical hit, the target is confused for 1 round by the pain. Creatures immune to critical hits, mind-affecting, or pain effects ignore the confusion. Even if you confirm multiple critical hits while this spell is in effect, an individual creature can only be confused by a single casting of <i>mindshock</i> once.

<p>
You erase a portion of the target&rsquo;s mind and experiences, inflicting 2 temporary negative levels on the target for 1 day per caster level. If the target is a spellcaster who must choose and prepare spells in advance, each negative level imposed by <i>mindwipe</i> also causes the target to lose one prepared spell from her highest level of spells known for each of her spellcasting classes for which she must prepare spells. These lost spells are no longer considered known by the target until the corresponding negative levels are removed.
</p>

<p>
If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, each negative level inflicted by <i>mindwipe</i> causes her to lose one spell slot of her highest level of spells for each spontaneous spellcasting class in which she has levels and to lose knowledge of one random spell known of that level (or the next lowest level if she has already lost knowledge of all spells known of that level, and so on). The target cannot use the lost spell slots and spells known as long as the corresponding negative levels last. When the target loses a spell known, the spell remains on her class list but she cannot prepare or cast the spell.
</p>

<p>
If the negative levels from <i>mindwipe</i> cause the target&rsquo;s total number of negative levels to equal or exceed her character level, instead of dying, she enters a catatonic state as long as the negative levels from <i>mindwipe</i> continue to cause her total number of negative levels to equal or exceed her character level.

You don&rsquo;t so much cast a <i>miracle</i> as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
A <i>miracle</i> can do any of the following things.
<ul>
	<li>	Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.
	<li>	Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
	<li>	Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as <i>feeblemind</i> or <i>insanity.</i>
	<li>	Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
</ul>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a <i>miracle</i> costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful <i>miracle</i>s of this sort could include the following:
<ul>
	<li>	Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
	<li>	Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.
	<li>	Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity&rsquo;s (or alignment&rsquo;s) nature is refused.
</p>

<p>
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a <i>miracle</i> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Hallucinatory Terrain">hallucinatory terrain</a></i>, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements.
</p>

<p>
Unlike <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>, the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still, it can&rsquo;t disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location).

You transform a mirror into a portal to an extradimensional space. The space can hold as many as eight Medium creatures. Creatures that enter this space are hidden and beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. If the mirror is covered (such as by a cloth, or by being placed face down or against a wall), the portal becomes inactive. If the mirror is broken or moved more than 5 feet from where it was when you cast the spell, the spell ends; any creatures within the extradimensional space are expelled from it; see below and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds.
</p>

<p>
Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the space can see and hear through it as if looking through an open window the same size as the mirror. Creatures outside the extradimensional space see only what is normally reflected in the mirror. Any creature in the space can make itself visible in the reflection of the mirror for 1 round at a time, however creatures outside the space cannot hear any sounds that originate inside.
</p>

<p>
Anything inside the extradimensional space is expelled when the spell ends (even if the mirror is covered). Only one creature at a time can enter the mirror, and creatures can enter only if they can fit through an opening the same size as the mirror. For example, a hand mirror isn&rsquo;t big enough for a Small or larger creature to use it as a portal.
</p>

<p>
Objects can enter the extradimensional space only if brought by a creature able to fully pass through the mirror.

<p>
This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you.
</p>

<p>
When <i>mirror image</i> is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created.
</p>

<p>
These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.
</p>

<p>
An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).

<p>
Whenever the target of this spell looks into a mirror or other reflective surface where it can see its own visage clearly, it sees a Red Mantis assassin (in full armor, face hidden by a mantis mask) looking back at it. The reflection is harmless and mimics the target&rsquo;s motions perfectly; no one else can see this illusion. The first time the target sees the Red Mantis reflection, it must succeed at a Will save be or shaken and take a &minus;2 penalty on saves against fear effects for as long as it can see the altered image and for 3 rounds thereafter. A new save must be attempted each time the creature views its reflection during the spell&rsquo;s duration. Once a creature successfully saves, it becomes immune to being shaken by the caster&rsquo;s <i>mirror mantis</i> spell for 24 hours, though it will still see the Red Mantis reflection until the spell ends.

You briefly alter the flow of time to split a melee attack into two attacks. Before the end of your next turn, when you make your next melee attack roll, compare the result to the AC of two opponents within your reach. If the selected opponents are flanking you, you gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll (and confirmation attack roll, see below). If you hit both enemies, you can deal half damage to each. Hitting only one opponent allows you to deal that opponent normal damage for your attack. On a critical threat, you can make only one attack roll to confirm the critical hit against both opponents. If you confirm against both, you deal half your critical hit damage to each. Your hit is a normal hit rather than a critical if you confirm against only one opponent. If you fail to use the effect before the end of your next turn, the spell ends.

You direct spirits into the shadows of creatures. The shadows of creatures that fail their Will saving throws appear slightly different for the duration of the spell, bearing small horns, unusually long and slender arms, or other small discrepancies. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. At will as an immediate action (but no more often than once every 10 minutes), a <i>mischievous shadow</i> can interfere with its host&rsquo;s actions or the actions of adjacent creatures by interacting with their shadows in ways that affect their physical counterparts, such as grabbing the shadow of a crossbow to redirect the physical weapon&rsquo;s aim. Each disruption either imposes a &minus;8 penalty on a single attack roll, combat maneuver check, or Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, or requires a spellcaster to succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) or lose a spell being cast. If you are within range of the spell effect, you can decide how these shadows interfere; otherwise, their actions are timed and decided by the GM as needed, typically manifesting during important or crucial roles. Each time a <i>mischievous shadow</i> makes such a disruption, the spell&rsquo;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.

By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (<i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>discern lies</i>, and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of <i>misdirection is</i> detected as if it were the other object. Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect. Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (<i>augury</i>, <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>, and the like).

You become invisible (as <i><a href="#Greater Invisibility">greater invisibility</a></i>, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as <i><a href="#Major Image">major image</a></i>, a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don&rsquo;t notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.

<p>
The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The <i>greater invisibility</i> lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.

You inscribe a rune on the target object. The rune remains dormant until the object finds its way into the hands of a spellcaster, at which point the rune steals one of that creature&rsquo;s spells and passes the knowledge back to you. The stolen spell is selected randomly. An object inscribed with this rune is affected as though by the spell <i><a href="#Magic Aura">magic aura</a></i>. Additionally, if a creature in possession of the object casts a spell that appears on your spell list, there is a 10% chance that the <i>mnemonic siphon</i> absorbs that spell, causing it to fail as though it had been successfully countered. Whenever the <i>mnemonic siphon</i> absorbs a spell in this fashion, it causes the knowledge of the absorbed spell to appear directly in your mind. You can use this knowledge to prepare the spell if you have an unused spell slot capable of casting it. You can also use the knowledge to write the spell into a spellbook or teach it to your familiar. This knowledge remains in your mind for 24 hours, after which time it is lost. The <i>mnemonic siphon</i> is capable of absorbing up to 1 spell per 2 caster levels you have before being discharged. If you are not capable of learning a stolen spell normally, the knowledge is useless to you.

You reach into the subject&rsquo;s mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.
<ul>
	<li>	Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate <i>charm</i>, <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>suggestion</i>, or similar spells.
	<li>	Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.
	<li>	Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.
	<li>	Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell&rsquo;s range during this time, the spell is lost.
</p>

<p>
A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject&rsquo;s actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature&rsquo;s natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream, too much wine, or another similar excuse.

You change one of the extremities of the creature touched&mdash;arms or legs only&mdash;into another shape of approximately the same size and mass. You can choose a tentacle, a hoof, or a wing.
</p>

<p>
The subject must take approximately 10 minutes to familiarize itself with the function and movement of the new extremity to use it properly. These new forms do not allow the subject to fly, run faster, or swim better; however, they do act as natural weapons of the appropriate type, and the subject can use them to make secondary attacks while making attacks with weapons as a full-attack action. The secondary attacks are made using the creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus &minus;5 and adding only &frac12; the creature&rsquo;s Strength bonus on damage rolls. The subject cannot hold a weapon or use any item that would ordinarily fit into the slot of the changed extremity. The subject can receive the benefits of this spell multiple times.

<p>
This spell conjures a miniature sphere of sunlight, approximately the size of a human fist, at a desired location within range. The sphere sheds bright light in a 60-foot-radius burst. Creatures that take penalties in bright light do so while within the sphere&rsquo;s area of illumination. Creatures that start their turns within the area of illumination and that are damaged or destroyed by sunlight must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered until 1d4+1 rounds after they leave the affected area. Non-creatures, such as hazardous fungi and mold that are destroyed by sunlight, become inert for the duration of the spell.
</p>

<p>
The sphere cannot be moved from the place it was cast. The sphere deals 10d6 points of fire damage to anything it touches and anything that passes within 5 feet of it. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half.

You imbue the target with an exaggerated sense of its own mortality and a drive for self-preservation. The target is shaken, and the first time each round the target takes damage (including the first round of the spell&rsquo;s duration), it must succeed at another Will save or its fear level increases by one step (from shaken to frightened, and from frightened to panicked). If the target fails a saving throw against this effect while panicked, it is transfixed in terror and is helpless for the remainder of the spell&rsquo;s duration. If the target succeeds at the initial Will save, it is shaken for 1 round but its fear level cannot be further increased by this spell&rsquo;s effects during that round.

</p>

<p>
The <i>motes of dusk and dawn</i> must stay within a 10-foot-radius area of one another but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The motes can move up to 100 feet per round. A mote winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell&rsquo;s range.

<i>Move earth</i> moves dirt (clay, loam, sand, and soil), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
In no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
</p>

<p>
This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacial fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.
</p>

<p>
The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.

In addition to its normal abilities, the crow gains the Improved Steal feat as a bonus feat and gains an eye rake attack. If both of its claw attacks hit the same living foe in a single round, that foe must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be blinded as the bird scratches and tears at the foe&rsquo;s eyes.

As any scholar of Desnan lore or astrologer can tell you, the music of the spheres is the harmonic constant that plays under and through all of reality.

With this spell, one can amplify the underlying music of the spheres in the spell&rsquo;s area of effect to infuse yourself and all creatures within 20 feet of you, friend and foe alike. All creatures that begin their turn within the area of this spell&rsquo;s effect gain fast healing 5, resistance 10 to all energy types, and a +3 sacred bonus on all saving throws against poison and disease. Any creature that enters the area of effect does not gain the benefits of the music of the spheres until it begins its turn in that area. You must maintain concentration on the amplification of the music or the effects immediately end, but you can move around to prevent enemies from gaining the benefits of this spell.

When you are under of the effects of your mutagen, you can cast this spell to safely pass it to another creature with a touch. You must make a successful touch attack against the target. On a hit, the effect of the mutagen passes to the target touched, though in a lesser form. The mutagen&rsquo;s effect ends for you, and passes on to the creature touched, but the target only gets half of the alchemical bonus to the physical ability modifier you chose when took the mutagen, and twice the penalty to the corresponding mental ability score. If the target&rsquo;s mental ability score drops below 3, the target is also confused for the remaining duration of the mutagen. The mutagen continues until the duration has ended. It can be ended earlier if the target drinks or is fed the contents of a vial of antitoxin, but with only 50% chance of success.
</p>

<p>
You can use this spell on a mutagen with either the greater mutagen or advance mutagen discoveries. When you do, you always pass on half the alchemical bonus to physical abilities and twice the penalty to the mental ability score.

You overstimulate the target with alternating flashes of light and shadow within its eyes, causing its pupils to rapidly dilate and contract. While under the effects of this spell, the target is racked by splitting headaches and unable to see clearly, becoming nauseated for the spell&rsquo;s duration. Each round, the target&rsquo;s pupils randomly become dilated or contracted for 1 round. During any round that its eyes are dilated, the target is blinded if exposed to bright light or dazzled if exposed to normal light. During any round its eyes are contracted, the target is blinded if exposed to darkness or dazzled if exposed to dim light. In addition, any creature can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from the target, even if the creature lacks cover or concealment.

You restrict the target&rsquo;s access to its mythic power. Each time the target attempts to cast a mythic spell, expend mythic power to activate a path ability, or use any other effect that requires expending uses of mythic power, it must attempt a Will saving throw against the DC of this spell. If it fails this saving throw, the creature loses its action and the ability it was attempting to use has no effect.

Whenever you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any type of Large naga (including most nagas, but not royal nagas), though not the form of a specific individual. In effect, you transform into a Large serpent, gaining a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a &minus;2 penalty to your Dexterity, and a +4 natural armor bonus.

<p>
You imbue the target with deadly accuracy against a selected creature type (and subtype for humanoids or outsiders) or a specific creature you know and can name. When used against the selected creature, the ammunition never misfires and is unaffected by concealment (but not total concealment), and at a range of 30 feet or less, the attack targets the selected creature&rsquo;s touch AC. When the target hits the selected creature, you must overcome that creature&rsquo;s spell resistance, or this spell has no effect. A normal hit scored using the target against the selected creature is considered to be a critical threat and deals 1 extra point of damage per caster level (maximum 20), which is not multiplied on a critical hit. A natural critical hit deals the same extra damage, but that damage is multiplied due to the critical.
</p>

<p>
Once the target is used to attack the selected creature, successfully or not, this spell is discharged.

You reduce the amount of uninterrupted sleep or rest creatures within the spell&rsquo;s area need in order to recover from injuries, regain spells, or other special abilities to 2 hours instead of the normal eight. In addition, if creatures continue to sleep or rest beyond the initial 2 hours, every additional 2 hours counts as a day of rest for the purpose of recovering hit points, ability damage, as well as for enduring diseases, poisons, or other afflictions. This means 8 total hours of sleep counts as 4 days for natural healing and for saving throws as diseases or similar afflictions run their course. When suffering from diseases, poison, or other afflictions, sleepers experience vivid dreams that help them track their recovery. If things go poorly they can, at any time, wake themselves up in order to seek a better alternative. If awoken or otherwise disturbed during this 8-hour period, creatures may return to sleep but they no longer enjoy the benefits of the accelerated recovery time. Creatures can only enjoy the benefits of this spell once in any 1-week period.

Each time the creature successfully strikes an opponent with a natural attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 bonus on damage rolls made against that opponent when making natural attacks (maximum +5 bonus). If an attack misses, the bonus to damage for all attacks resets to +0.

This spell curses the creature touched, making it inimical to the natural world. All animals have an initial attitude of hostile toward the target. Familiars, being magical beasts, are not affected by this spell, but animal companions are. If you have an animal companion, it does not become hostile, but as long as you remain cursed, your animal companion takes a &minus;2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. The target also takes a &minus;10 penalty on Survival skill checks as the weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause trouble.

The target instinctively knows the shortest, easiest, and fastest way through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the target treats any trackless terrain as though there were a trail or road, and any terrain with a road or trail as though there were a highway. Up to one creature per caster level traveling with the target can also benefit from the effect. The spell functions only outdoors and does not function in magically altered terrain.

You make an undead creature more difficult for necromancers and clerics to control via effects such as Command Undead or <i>control undead</i>. If the target fails its Will save, the target&rsquo;s effective number of Hit Dice is doubled for the purposes of determining whether it remains under the control of another creature.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the target&rsquo;s actual Hit Dice, its effective HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. (For example, a 12th-level cleric could cast this spell to cause an undead creature with 15 HD to instead effectively have 24 HD for the purpose of controlling it.) If the targeted undead is under the control of another creature and this spell causes the target&rsquo;s effective Hit Dice to exceed the controller&rsquo;s maximum capability, the target creature is immediately freed from control. Any creature capable of controlling undead may attempt to control the target, provided the target&rsquo;s effective HD won&rsquo;t cause the would-be controller to exceed its HD limit. The target&rsquo;s former controller can attempt to regain control over the target by relinquishing command over other creatures until its HD limit is no longer exceeded (or the former controller can wait until the spell&rsquo;s duration expires to attempt this at the target&rsquo;s normal HD).

With a gesture, this spell allows you to dismiss even the foulest or most distinctive scents. When cast, the targeted creatures or objects lose all natural and unnatural odors. A creature under the effect of <i>negate aroma</i> cannot be tracked, located, or pinpointed by the scent special quality. In addition, this spell prevents the target creature from using the stench special ability and similar odor-based abilities (such as those possessed by troglodytes).
</p>

<p>
<i>Negate aroma</i> does not prevent the target from acquiring outside smells or odors. Dowsing the creature with a pungent substance effectively negates the benefits of the spell until the substance is neutralized or washed away.

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each poison affecting the target. Success means that the poison is neutralized. A cured creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don&rsquo;t go away on their own.
</p>

<p>
This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for 10 minutes per level, at the caster&rsquo;s option.
</p>

<p>
If cast on a creature, the creature receives a Will save to negate the effect.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Neutralize Poison">neutralize poison</a></i>, except as noted here. You automatically succeed at all caster level checks to neutralize any poisons affecting the target creature. The spell also reverses all instantaneous or permanent effects caused by poisons, such as temporary ability damage or permanent ability drain (it does not heal ability drain caused by anything other than poison, however). If you use the spell to neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object, the duration is 1 hour per level rather than 10 minutes per level. If the spell is cast on a creature, the creature can negate the effect by succeeding at a Will saving throw.

Your target&rsquo;s vision becomes impaired as if the light level were one step lower, treating bright light as normal light, normal light as dim light, and dim light as darkness.

The subject gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist the blind or dazzled condition caused by bright light (such as flare). <i>Remove blindness/deafness</i> dispels <i>night blindness</i>.

<p>
The target of this spell gains no benefit from normal or magical sleep, writhing in a series of nightmares that torture its psyche and diminish its ability to perform strenuous tasks. The target doesn&rsquo;t heal ability or hit point damage naturally and can&rsquo;t prepare spells or regain spell slots. After one night of poor sleep, the target is fatigued (or exhausted if it was fatigued before trying to rest). A creature affected by this spell doesn&rsquo;t recover from the fatigued or exhausted condition inflicted by this spell after resting, nor do spells such as <i>lesser restoration</i> provide any respite. Each restless night, the target takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, which also can&rsquo;t be recovered by magic while <i>night terrors</i> is active.
</p>

<p>
The images from previous nightmares continue to haunt the target&rsquo;s mind while awake. If the target has rested at least once while affected by <i>night terrors</i> and then becomes subjected to a fear condition, the target experiences the next higher level of fear than it would normally. However, per the alternate rules for fear, this spell cannot cause a lesser state of fear to become a greater one. If the effect causing the fear condition doesn&rsquo;t usually stack with other fear effects, the target&rsquo;s level of fear does not increase. This aspect of the spell is a fear effect.
</p>

<p>
The affected creature can attempt a new saving throw once per day to end <i>night terrors</i>, but multiple attempts to rest in a given day do not afford the target multiple saves. A creature that successfully saves against <i>night terrors</i> ends the spell and rests normally that night but gains the benefits of only that night&rsquo;s rest, not any benefits missed on previous nights.
</p>

<p>
If your campaign uses the sanity system, the target takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.

This spell creates an unearthly and infectious song that seductively summons all who hear it. Nixie&rsquo;s lure affects a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures in the area who fail their saves are lured by the song and move toward you using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures each receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Creatures lured by the spell&rsquo;s song can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of you simply stands still and for the duration of the spell remains fascinated.

You can use the Path of Numbers to calculate the latent magical energies all around you and fire customized rays of elemental energy that damage nearby targets. Roll 1d6 per 2 caster levels you possess. This is your dice pool. You will use each die in the pool exactly once to customize <i>numerological evocation</i>. Choose a number of dice in the pool, and match their results to the values in the first column of the Eight Basic Energies table to determine the types of energy damage the spell deals. You can allocate any number of dice in this manner, provided you still have enough dice remaining for the subsequent steps.
</p>

<p>
Next, allocate one of the dice to represent the total number of target creatures you can affect, including the initial target. No matter how many creatures you are eligible to affect, no two affected creatures can be more than 15 feet apart. Next, allocate any number of the dice to represent the range of <i>numerological resistance</i>. The range of the spell is 10 &times; the sum of the allocated dice. Finally, add up the results of the dice remaining in the pool. This is the amount of damage that <i>numerological evocation</i> deals to the first creature hit. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. Secondary targets take 50% of the damage dealt to the first creature hit (rounded up), and successful Reflex saves negate this damage.

<i>Numerological resistance</i> allows numerologists to use the Path of Numbers to grant their allies resilience in the face of elemental dangers. Roll 5d8; this is your dice pool. You will use each die in the pool exactly once to customize <i>numerological resistance</i>.
</p>

<p>
Choose one of the dice, and match its result to the appropriate value in the first column of the Eight Basic Energies table to determine the type of energy to which <i>numerological resistance</i> grants resistance. Next, allocate one of the dice to represent the number of creatures you can affect with <i>numerological resistance</i> (including yourself). All of these creatures must be within the spell&rsquo;s range. Then allocate one of the dice to represent the number of rounds <i>numerological resistance</i> lasts. Finally, sum the remaining two dice. This is the number of points of resistance that <i>numerological resistance</i> grants.

<p>
This spell functions in any natural terrain on the Material Plane. It redirects the flow of water in the ground toward the surface at the designated point, creating a permanent water source similar to a natural spring. The spring discharges 5 gallons of pure drinking water per caster level each hour. If the shape of the terrain is suitable, a pond forms around the spring. If there is already a natural spring within 1 mile, its water output is reduced by an amount equal to the water produced by this spell&rsquo;s spring. A spring that has its water output reduced to 0 gallons per hour dries up and ceases to be a spring.
</p>

<p>
This spell functions differently depending on the terrain in which it&rsquo;s cast. In a desert, you must succeed at a DC 25 caster level check to actually create the spring, and its output is 1 gallon of drinking water per caster level each day. Furthermore, in dry areas, erosion may cause the flow of water to be blocked if the affected area is left untended before a sufficient amount of vegetation has grown around it to keep the soil in place. In an arctic environment, low temperatures may cause the water to freeze. In a tropical environment, parasites may contaminate the water if the spring is created in a place where the water stands in a stagnant pool.

You swear an oath not to reveal your identity, magically preventing anyone from discovering it so long as you avoid revealing your face or other easily identifiable features. The spell distorts your voice and subtly alters your body language and the appearance of your gear and any animals you use, whether as companions, mounts, or otherwise. This spell does not make you appear to be a different creature type, nor does it change your apparent height or body type.
</p>

<p>
This spell provides you with a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to conceal your identity, but not on checks to impersonate anyone in particular. This spell distorts the appearance of your voice, gear, and animals in the same way each time, essentially creating an alternate persona that can be recognized by those who have observed it before.

This spell seals a solemn vow between two creatures. When this spell is cast, the targets must clasp hands and swear their oath in Kols&rsquo;s name. The spell functions like <i><a href="#Mark of Justice">mark of justice</a></i>, except as noted above and rather than being cursed, the oath-breaker gains a mark on the face indicating to all dwarves who see it that the target has broken a sacred oath, which gives the oath-breaker a &minus;4 penalty to influence dwarves. The mark can be removed as described in the <i>mark of justice</i>spell, or the other target can forgive the oath-breaker, which causes the mark to vanish.

You create a latent illusion that clouds the judgment and reading ability of any creature that examines a targeted text. While casting the spell, you can designate up to one creature other than yourself per level to be immune to the effects. All other creatures that read the text must succeed at a Will save or find it difficult to properly parse and decipher the contents. This increases the DC of Linguistics checks to decipher the text by an amount equal to your caster level (maximum +10), and it increases the DC of the Wisdom check to avoid drawing a false conclusion by an equal amount. Unaffected creatures gain a circumstance bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on Bluff checks to deceive affected creatures about the text&rsquo;s contents. The spell obscures any magical glyphs, runes, or symbols within the text, increasing the Perception DC to find such traps by an amount equal to half your caster level (maximum +5). <i>Obscured script</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.

You alter the appearance of a door and disguise whether it is open or closed. You can cause the touched door to appear closed regardless of whether it is open or closed, to appear open regardless of whether it is open or closed, or to appear to open or close. After you cast the spell, you can change between these options as a move action. Creatures using a move action to open or shut the door can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of how you alter the appearance of the door, creatures that believe the illusion take a &minus;5 penalty on Perception checks regarding the door itself or creatures on the other side of the door.

You cast this spell in response to a specific cavalier&rsquo;s challenge, inquisitor&rsquo;s judgment, or smite (such as a paladin&rsquo;s smite evil) declared against you by an enemy creature. It can also be cast if a creature uses a spell that causes you to qualify as the creature&rsquo;s favored enemy when you normally wouldn&rsquo;t, such as <i>instant enemy</i>.
</p>

<p>
You imbue your weapon with a powerful ability to ward off attacks made against you by the creature that challenged you. You gain a +5 insight bonus to your AC and CMD against the attacks of the initiating creature as long as you hold the weapon. If you release the weapon for any reason, the spell ends. You can cast this spell only in response to one of the conditions listed above. The spell fails if you attempt to cast it when you were not subject to a challenge or similar effect since your last turn.

<p>
To cast <i>open the Dead Roads</i>, you must be in an area of fog or dim light. Upon completion of the spell, swirling mists part and deposit you and any creatures you touched on a nearby stretch of the Dead Roads, a network of extraplanar roadways. You can take up to one creature per level, but all targets must be touching each other. You must specify a location known to you or one of your travelers as your destination when casting this spell.
</p>

<p>
When traveling the otherworldly paths of the Dead Roads, you move at a speed of 50 miles per hour regardless of the terrain on the Material Plane. Your own movement speed does not change; you simply arrive at distant destinations more quickly because the Dead Roads offer a shorter route. You can exit the Dead Roads at any point before reaching your destination by wandering off the path, in which case you are usually returned to your starting place. If this would place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available.
</p>

<p>
Because the Dead Roads occupy another plane, it is impossible to spy on the Material Plane while using this spell without additional spells or supernatural abilities.
</p>

<p>
<i>Open the Dead Roads</i> can be used to travel to or from the Shadow Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Plane, or the Boneyard; any of these destinations requires 10 hours of travel. Thanks to their unique nature, the Dead Roads can be used to travel from any plane to the Material Plane&mdash;a trip likewise requiring 10 hours&mdash;unless that plane normally bars all extraplanar travel.
</p>

<p>
Creatures you bring with you to the Dead Roads are not obligated to follow you. If they wander off, there is an 80% chance they arrive at a random point on the Material Plane within 2d6&times;10 miles of your starting point, otherwise they arrive in the Boneyard.

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container.

Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell&rsquo;s ability to affect.

Cast this spell when a creature within range casts a spell that provides an effect for its allies (such as <i>bless</i> or <i>prayer</i>). You are considered an ally of the caster for the purposes of that spell. Although you are momentarily considered an ally, the caster need not target you if the spell requires that the caster select one or more allies to be affected by the spell (as does haste). This spell does not allow a target spell to affect more creatures than described in its target entry. If this spell would raise the total number of affected targets above that allowed by the target spell, <i>opportunistic loyalty</i> has no effect.

You create a small weightless sphere of pure negative energy. As a move action, you can move it up to 30 feet per round in any direction. If it enters a space with a living creature, it stops moving for the round and that creature gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Any creature passing through or ending its turn in the space occupied by the sphere gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Twenty-four hours after gaining a negative level from the sphere, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC of this save is equal to the DC of this spell) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent.
</p>

<p>
If more than one orb (from different castings of the spell) enters the same space, the orbs automatically fuse together. The resulting orb uses the higher of the two orbs&rsquo; DCs as its DC and whichever duration has more time left. If the orbs are from different casters, each must make an opposed Intelligence check to move the sphere.
</p>

<p>
An undead creature that passes through or ends its turn in the space occupied by the orb gains 2d4 &times; 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

Although they have yet to unlock the elixir&rsquo;s exact formula, their efforts have not been entirely wasted. One by-product of their experiments was the orchid&rsquo;s drop formula. This extract, distilled from a much-diluted drop of the nectar of a sun orchid flower, can transform an alchemist&rsquo;s mutagen into a potent healing tonic.
</p>

<p>
As long as you&rsquo;re under the effects of orchid&rsquo;s drop, drinking a dose of your mutagen heals you of 2d10 points of damage. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving throws.

The spell inhibits the memories of creatures that perceive you. While creatures can perceive you normally, when a creature stops observing you, it must attempt a Will save (spell resistance applies). If it fails, it loses all memory of its awareness of you and your actions while you were under the effects of this spell. The spell&rsquo;s duration listed above measures how long the <i>out of sight</i> effect lasts on you, but the memory alteration is instantaneous and can be reversed only by magic such as <i>modify memory</i>.

You enhance your natural ability to seem small and unimportant, causing those around you to overlook you. You gain a +20 bonus on Stealth checks, which doesn&rsquo;t stack with bonuses from effects that actually make you sneakier, such as <i>invisibility</i> or <i>respectful quiet</i>; you do not need cover or concealment to hide; and you can hide while you are being observed. If a creature fails to notice you because of this spell, that creature can still remember seeing a halfling pass by, but attach no importance to the memory. You do not gain these benefits against creatures that are immune to compulsions or mind-affecting effects, and spell resistance applies. If you take an actively aggressive or extremely conspicuous action, creatures automatically notice you, and you gain no further benefits against those creatures for the remainder of the spell&rsquo;s duration.

Your presence inspires incredible awe in those nearby. A creature that fails a save against this spell falls to the ground and prostrates itself before you, believing it bows before a divine presence. A flying creature incapable of hovering must land immediately in order to prostrate itself. These creatures are considered to be helpless for the duration of the spell.
</p>

<p>
Each round on its turn, a target of this spell may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; this is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature that recovers from this spell early after being affected by it for at least 1 round takes 1d6 points of Wisdom drain and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A creature that makes the initial save to resist this spell is merely staggered for 1 round.

You create an instinctual connection between the targets. Each can sense the others&rsquo; overall emotional states, which allows them to communicate basic emotional concepts (such as alerting each other of danger due to increased stress). Once the spell has been cast on the subjects, the distance between them and the caster doesn&rsquo;t affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.

You magically scour the world&rsquo;s libraries for information that might refresh your memory about a topic. Upon casting this spell, the focus book&rsquo;s pages fill with snippets and selections from countless books. You can spend up to 1 round per caster level (maximum 10) reading these notes. You may cease reading at any time, and when you do you can immediately attempt one Knowledge check with a +1 circumstance bonus for each round you spent studying the book (maximum +10). The writing disappears when the spell ends, and if you fail to succeed at a Knowledge check on the round you stop reading the notes, you don&rsquo;t gain the benefits of this spell.

You augment an ongoing illusion effect to strike out painfully at creatures that see through it. When a creature successfully disbelieves an illusion that is the target of <i>painful revelation</i>, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces the nonlethal damage by half and negates the staggered effect. Once <i>painful revelation</i> has been triggered, the spell ends.

You open up a brief but powerful divine conduit between you and another creature, taking on the damage and any other effects that creature suffers. When a creature in range is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, you can cast this spell and the wounds and/or effects are magically transmitted to you instead of the target. You are affected as if you were hit by the attack or failed the saving throw, taking all the damage and suffering all of the adverse effects. Any resistances or immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or effects in any way.
</p>

<p>
If you use this spell against an effect that also targets you or includes you in its area, you suffer the effects for both yourself and the target you spared, potentially taking damage or suffering other consequences twice.

The targets&rsquo; physical forms undergo a bizarre transformation. They look and function normally, but are composed of countless particles that separate and reconnect to remain whole. Each target gains fast healing 1 and is immune to bleed damage, critical hits, sneak attacks, and other forms of precision damage. The value of this fast healing increases by 1 at caster levels 10th, 15th, and 20th. Any target can end the spell effect on itself as a swift action; the target then regains 5d6 hit points and can attempt an additional saving throw against any one disease or poison affecting it (at the original save DC), ending that disease or poison with a successful saving throw.

Taldor&rsquo;s infamous Lion Blades imported this spell from the ninja clans of Minkai, and both groups use it to great effect when maneuvering among the shallow upper classes. When you cast the spell, you dictate one specific topic or recent event and instill a magical obsession with that subject within the target. An affected creature becomes fascinated by the topic, and becomes completely focused on discussing the event with anyone nearby, possibly wandering off or distracting unaffected creatures. <i>Passing fancy</i> has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence of 2 or less.
</p>

<p>
Because the target talks and interacts with its usual cadence, onlookers take a &minus;10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to notice that anything is amiss with the target&rsquo;s behavior.

You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall&rsquo;s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single <i>passwall</i> simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several <i>passwall</i> spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When <i>passwall</i> ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the <i>passwall</i> or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.

Allies that end their turns on a glowing square (including one who falls unconscious in the square) are healed of 1 point of damage.

With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to clear a path ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a windstorm. During the first round of the spell, the winds sweep the designated area clear of anything of Small or smaller size, blowing it outward to the sides of the spell&rsquo;s effect (50% chance of landing on either side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though all other creatures are subject to the wind&rsquo;s effects. On the second and all later rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a wind wall. If the effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds create a channel up to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid. On your turn as a move action, you can move the effect of this spell, either rotating it at one of its ends up to 45 degrees, or moving it up to 50 feet in line with its current orientation (toward you or away from you).

<i>Pattern recognition</i> allows you to notice unusual breaks in the patterns of stones in a wall, boards in a floor, cracks in glass, trees in a forest, or similar interruptions. You gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (minimum +1, maximum +10) on Search checks.

This spell creates one glowing rune of peace, plus one per 2 caster levels above 1st (to a maximum of five runes at 9th level). An identical symbol appears on your forehead for the duration of the spell and cannot be disguised (though it is visible only if you are visible). Each rune illuminates a 5-foot cube, preventing any spell you cast of up to 3rd level and that has a defined area (as opposed to targets or an effect) from entering or affecting the 5-foot cube. For example, creatures and items within any square affected by <i>peace bond</i> take no damage from a <i>fireball</i> you cast. However, if you cast <i>stinking cloud</i>, the noxious vapors are an effect and enter such cubes normally. This spell does not break line of effect within any other spells you cast; it simply negates all effects of your 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-level area spells within the <i>peace bond</i>&rsquo;s area. <i>Peace bond</i> offers no protection against your spell-like abilities or supernatural area effects.

<p>
If a target weapon is sheathed or slung as the spell is cast, this functions as <i><a href="#Peacebond">peacebond</a></i>, locking the target&rsquo;s weapon in place on its owner&rsquo;s body or within the weapon&rsquo;s sheath or holster. Anyone who then tries to draw the weapon must spend a standard action and succeed at a Strength check to do so, provoking attacks of opportunity whether the attempt succeeds or fails. The DC for Strength checks required by this spell is equal to the spell&rsquo;s save DC.
</p>

<p>
If a target weapon is not currently sheathed or slung as the spell is cast, the weapon immediately attempts to sheathe itself, and its wielder must succeed at a Strength check to prevent it from doing so. Once sheathed or slung in this way, the weapon is difficult to draw, as previously noted above. Unattended weapons that are not currently sheathed or slung are anchored in place by the spell, and require a successful Strength check to pick up; each attempt requires a standard action. If the wielder doesn&rsquo;t have a sheath or sling available for the weapon, failure on the Strength check causes the weapon to fall to the ground, at which point it requires a Strength check to pick up, as with unattended weapons.

<p>
You transform one or more improvised weapons into equivalent simple or martial weapons. The bearer of such a weapon can wield it with proficiency (no penalty for using an improvised weapon or not having the required proficiency). This does not alter the weapon&rsquo;s shape or appearance in any way. For example, if cast on a chair leg, butter knife, and pitchfork, the weapons function as a club, dagger, and trident, respectively, and anyone who wields them does so without a nonproficiency penalty, but the weapons look no different than they were before the spell.
</p>

<p>
The spell has no effect on items that are not improvised weapons. For example, if cast on a short sword, it does not grant proficiency to anyone wielding it.

<i>Peerless integrity</i> conceals the alignment of creatures from divination magic. All creatures within the spell&rsquo;s area, including you, appear to have lawful good auras for the purposes of divination spells and effects that reveal alignments (such as <i>detect law</i> and <i>see alignment</i>), instead of their actual alignments. If the caster of such divination magic succeeds at a Will save, the caster recognizes whether the readings are true or false. Any creature under the effects of this spell gains a +2 circumstance modifier on Bluff and Diplomacy checks.

For example, they can determine your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the gist of your actions (such as, &ldquo;She was trying to break into the store&rdquo;), but cannot determine your precise actions, your appearance, or any identifying information about you.

Unlike most illusions with a save to disbelieve, if the target disbelieves a <i>permanent hallucination</i>, she can choose to end the effect entirely at any time.

You weaken the target&rsquo;s defenses against poison. The target gains a &minus;4 penalty on saves against poison, and poisons affecting the target continue for another 2 frequency increments (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned target with skill or magic take a &minus;4 penalty.

<p>
You summon intangible forces of whimsy to perform a variety of tricks and pranks upon your foes. Each round on your turn (including the round you cast this spell), these incorporeal pranksters perform a single dirty trick, disarm, steal, or trip combat maneuver against one of your foes within the spell&rsquo;s range. The whimsical forces have a bonus on combat maneuver checks equal to your caster level + your primary spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Charisma for sorcerers, etc.). Unless the target of the combat maneuver can see invisible creatures or forces, the spell gains an additional +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks.
</p>

<p>
The whimsical forces choose a random foe to target with their pranks on and randomly determine which combat maneuver to use. You can attempt to convince them to take a particular course of action with a DC 20 Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check as a standard action. If successful, you determine their target and the type of combat maneuver they use for that round.

The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its Strength.

For every 5 caster levels you have, the target can choose to increase the enhancement bonus by an additional 2, taking an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and decreasing the duration by 1 additional round per increase to the Strength bonus, to a maximum enhancement bonus of +10 and 4d6 points of nonlethal damage at caster level 15th. The subject can&rsquo;t spend more rounds than remain in the duration. When the spell ends, the subject becomes fatigued.

<p>
You erode the target&rsquo;s confidence and instill a sense of despair. This fear of failure manifests as a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Additionally, the target can&rsquo;t gain morale bonuses of any kind while the spell remains in effect. No amount of achievement counters the spell&rsquo;s effects&mdash;the target simply explains away positive events with a self-critical perspective.
</p>

<p>
Certain events can solidify the character&rsquo;s belief that it is doomed. Whenever the target rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll or saving throw, fails an ability or skill check by more than 5, or takes additional damage as a result of a foe&rsquo;s confirmed critical hit, the penalty to roll imposed by <i>pessimism</i> becomes &minus;3 for 1 round. This increased penalty doesn&rsquo;t stack, even if multiple catastrophes occur on the same round.

<p>
After a particularly harrowing brush with death at the hands of doppelgangers, Venture-Captain Eliza Petulengro devised a means of being sure her companions were actually who they appeared to be. To cast this spell, you must have a bit of hair, a fingernail clipping, or some other portion of a creature. The sample must be no more than 1 week old per caster level. As part of casting, you touch the target creature, and instantly know whether the target is the same creature the sample is from. Note that if you wish to be discrete, you can cast the spell away from the target and hold the charge before touching the creature, so that the casting is not noticed. You can also use this spell to divine whether a dead body, or even partial remains from a body, belonged to the same person whose fingernail clipping or bit of hair you used when casting the spell.

<p>
Since the affliction exists entirely in the creature&rsquo;s mind, <i>phantasmal affliction</i> is not affected by normal cures like <i>neutralize poison</i> or <i>remove disease</i>, or other effects like <i>delay poison</i> or the Heal skill. Ordinary immunities do not apply in this case (though a creature immune to the affliction receives a +4 bonus on the Will save to disbelieve the illusion). Constitution damage from the affliction can&rsquo;t kill the target. Instead, it causes the target to fall unconscious like other forms of ability damage. <i>Phantasmal affliction</i> is a spell effect and can be dispelled normally.

Your target must succeed at a Will save or believe it can no longer breathe. An affected target must attempt a Fortitude save each round at the beginning of its turn. The first time it fails the Fortitude save, it is staggered until the next time it attempts a save against the spell. If the target fails a second Fortitude save in a row, it falls unconscious for the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration. The target breathes normally while unconscious, but is shaken for 1 minute upon awakening. If the target succeeds at two Fortitude saves in a row, it shakes off the spell&rsquo;s effects entirely. Otherwise, the target continues to attempt a save each round until it falls unconscious or the spell ends. This spell has no effect on creatures that don&rsquo;t need to breathe.

You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that their skin is rotting away, large rents are appearing all over their bodies, and their internal organs are spilling out into a putrid half-liquid mass at their feet. Those who fail to disbelieve <i>phantasmal putrefaction</i> immediately take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. This damage occurs only once. Each round at the beginning of its turn, an affected target receives another Will save to disbelieve the effect, and targets that fail must succeed at a Fortitude save or faint, falling asleep as per <i><a href="#Sleep">sleep</a></i> (except that it isn&rsquo;t a magical <i>sleep</i> effect). Waking up doesn&rsquo;t end the spell for a target; it must continue to attempt Will saves to disbelieve and Fortitude saves to avoid fainting each round until the spell ends or the target successfully disbelieves.
</p>

<p>
Targets of the spell perceive everyone else around them to be rotting away, but other creatures see no visible effect of the spell, so they, in addition to those who disbelieve, can communicate the nature of the illusion to allies, providing those allies with a +4 bonus on the saving throw to disbelieve.
</p>

If your campaign uses the sanity system, a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.

You create a memory loop of a successful attack made against the target, forcing its conscious mind to recall the details of the attack in such excruciating detail that its physical body is racked by the recollection. This spell can affect only a creature that has taken damage since the end of your last turn. The target first can attempt a Will save to recognize the attack as unreal. If it fails that saving throw, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or take an amount of damage equal to 1d6 &times; your caster level (maximum 10d6). Because the damage is a quasi-real memory of existing wounds, this damage can&rsquo;t be reduced or prevented (such as by the <i>shield other</i> spell).
</p>

<p>
If the target of a <i>phantasmal reminder</i> attack succeeds at the Will save to disbelieve the memory loop and either has natural telepathy or is wearing a <i>helm of telepathy</i>, the memory of damage automatically rebounds to affect you. You must immediately attempt a Will save to disbelieve; if you fail, you take half the spell&rsquo;s damage yourself.

When you cast this eerie spell upon a recently slain creature, you cause a ghastly, spectral image of it to rise up from its corpse, shrieking for vengeance before it vanishes in a burst of unnatural light. This phantom then unerringly seeks out the creature that killed it, as long as that creature is on the same plane, and tries to slay its killer in turn.
</p>

<p>
Only the corpse&rsquo;s killer can see the phantasmal image created by this spell. You and any others who witness the spell&rsquo;s casting or its ultimate effects see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. If that save fails, the target must succeed on Fortitude saving throw or take 10 points of damage per caster level from the phantasmal image. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. You know immediately if the spell succeeded or failed to kill its target but gain no other information, including the identity of the target of the spell.
</p>

<p>
The creature providing the corpse must have died no more than 1 day per caster level prior to the casting of this spell. If the creature that provided the corpse was not, in fact, killed by another, or if the killer is dead or no longer on the same plane, the spell fails. <i>Phantasmal revenge</i> makes no moral judgments; it targets winners of fair fights just as easily as murderers. Any given body can only be targeted by a <i>phantasmal revenge</i> spell once.

You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that they are engulfed in tangled webs teeming with swarms of tiny spiders. Those who fail to disbelieve the <i>phantasmal web</i> are treated as if in a <i><a href="#Web">web</a></i> spell, but must also make a Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn or become nauseated for that round by the phantasmal spiders.
</p>

<p>
As the <i>phantasmal web</i> exists only in the minds of the targets, it cannot be burned or destroyed, and it provides no cover (though it does provide concealment) against attacks made by the targets. Targets cannot escape the <i>phantasmal web</i> by moving, even by teleportation. <i>Freedom of movement</i> allows unobstructed movement but does not negate the concealment or nausea effects.

You conjure a quasi-real heavy chariot with four horselike creatures in a team to pull it. (The exact description can be customized as you wish.) The chariot has all the normal qualities of a heavy chariot. You or a person you designate while casting the spell must drive the chariot, which can carry up to six passengers (including the driver). The team and chariot make no sound and the team does not fight, although the driver can use the chariot like any normal chariot.
</p>

<p>
The chariot and team are essentially a single entity with an AC of 19 (&minus;2 size, +6 natural armor, +5 Dex), and 10 hit points + 2 hit points per caster level (maximum 50). If the entity loses all its hit points, it disappears, possibly subjecting all aboard to a crash (treat as wrecked). The entity gains certain powers according to caster level, just like a mount does in the <i><a href="#Phantom Steed">phantom steed</a></i> spell.

You conjure a Small or Medium, quasi-real, humanlike creature (the exact physical features can be customized as you wish). This creation can drive any vehicle you command it to. This phantom creature does not fight, and while animals that power a muscle-propelled vehicle driven by the creature do respond to its commands, animals otherwise shun the creature and refuse to attack it.
</p>

<p>
The rider has an AC of 20 (+1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) if it is a Small creature or an AC of 19 (+4 natural armor, +5 Dexterity) if it is a Medium creature. It has 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom driver disappears. A phantom driver has a land speed of 30 feet, and makes all driver skill checks (no matter what skills are needed to drive the vehicle) as your caster level + your Intelligence modifier.

This spell creates a semi-visible psychic manifestation that allows a creature to replace a missing body part or parts. This could be as simple as a missing finger or toe or as complex as one or more limbs or even a set of wings. The creature can use these ghostly appendages exactly as if they were the creature&rsquo;s own limbs, including any natural attacks or other special abilities. This includes any extraordinary abilities granted by the appendages, but not supernatural ones.
</p>

You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound.
</p>

<p>
It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.
</p>

<p>
The mount is AC 18 (&minus;1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider&rsquo;s weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is certain a real trap exists.

<p>
This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The <i>phase door</i> is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the <i>phase door</i> and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A <i>gem of true seeing</i> or similar magic reveals the presence of a <i>phase door</i> but does not allow its use.
</p>

<p>
A <i>phase door</i> is subject to <i>dispel magic.</i> If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a <i><a href="#Passwall">passwall</a></i> effect.
</p>

<p>
You can allow other creatures to use the <i>phase door</i> by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature&rsquo;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don&rsquo;t qualify.
</p>

<p>
<i>Phase door</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

You select one enemy and one willing ally as targets. The enemy gains a new Will saving throw at the beginning of each turn, and on a successful saving throw the spell ends. Both targets remain visible and audible, and can see and hear other creatures, but cannot physically interact with any creature save one another. Spells or weapon attacks from the affected creatures impact only each other, though spells might affect terrain or other factors not related to other creatures. If one of the creatures becomes unconscious or dies, or if the effect is dispelled, the effect ends for both of them.

You instill the target with an intense, instinctual fear of a condition or circumstance, more powerful than the phobia lesser madness. You can name an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), a hazard (such as an avalanche or earthquake), or a single creature of the animal type or all vermin (applying when the target sees a swarm or a single Small or larger creature). Alternatively, you can name the following specific environments: darkness (darker than dim light, and you can&rsquo;t apply this phobia to a creature with natural racial darkvision, see in darkness, blindsight, or similar senses), enclosed spaces (places that require the creature to squeeze), heights (10 times the target&rsquo;s height, and you can&rsquo;t apply this phobia to creatures with a natural fly speed), or water (you can&rsquo;t apply this phobia to aquatic creatures or creatures with a natural swim speed).
</p>

<p>
When the target takes damage of the energy type (for an energy type phobia), or perceives the presence of the creature, environment, or hazard, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it fails, it becomes panicked, but even if it succeeds, it becomes shaken and feels intensely uncomfortable; a creature shaken in this way does not need to roll further saving throws against its phobia until its shaken condition ends, even if it continues to be exposed to its phobia.
</p>

<p>
A creature panicked by <i>phobia</i> can begin to act normally 1 minute after it ceases being able to perceive its phobia or after taking the energy damage if the phobia is an energy type, though the shaken condition ends immediately after the creature can no longer perceive its phobia. <i>Break enchantment</i>, <i>heal</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> can remove a <i>phobia</i> spell.

This spell temporarily converts even the deadliest poison affecting a creature into an intoxicating alcohol. If the subject is affected by a poison effect while under the effects of this spell, instead of the poison&rsquo;s normal effect, she feels intoxicated as if she&rsquo;d just had a very strong drink and takes a &minus;2 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks for the duration of the spell.

You call forth a melody so compelling and attractive that creatures belonging to a group with a specific, identifiable physical trait (such as type, subtype, age, gender, or hair color) find it almost impossible not to approach and follow you. You choose the nature of the creatures you seek to attract when you cast the spell and, once you make this choice, cannot alter it. You can only use physical traits to determine your audience. You can never use social and other more voluntary criteria (such as alignment, religion, nationality, or class) to select targets for this spell.
</p>

<p>
Eligible creatures must make a saving throw each round spent within the area of the spell and, once they fail, approach you at their normal movement speed and stand as close to you as possible without actually entering an occupied square.
</p>

<p>
If you move, they do their best to maintain their proximity to you and follow. Affected creatures can take no actions other than listening to your music and following you if you move.
</p>

<p>
Those entering the area while the spell is in effect must also successfully save or be compelled to come to you.
</p>

<p>
The attractive power of the spell does not cause affected creatures to put themselves in jeopardy and they have enough presence of mind to avoid or negotiate around obstacles and other perilous hazards. If unable to approach or follow you without endangering themselves, they simply wait, swaying to the music, until you pass out of range, at which point they regain their senses after 1 round/caster level. If circumstances change once you move out of range, making it possible for affected creatures to resume their attempts to get near you they do so, and, if they manage to return to within the area of the spell before it wears off, the spell continues as normal.
</p>

<p>
If attacked, affected creatures can take defensive measures, even going so far as to avoid existing threats by moving out of the area of the spell, but cannot make attacks themselves or take any other actions until the effects of the spell wear off. The effects of the spell persist for 1 round/caster level even after you stop concentrating. Once the spell ceases, the affected creatures continue to stay near you until the effects of the spell wear off.

<p>
This spell can be cast only on a sleeping creature, which must be present for the full duration of the casting time. You grant the semblance of wakefulness to the target, allowing it to answer questions. You can ask one question per 2 caster levels. The target&rsquo;s knowledge is limited to what it normally knows, including the languages it speaks. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you when awake. If the target succeeds at a Will save, it awakens (unless some force is preventing it from being awake, such as magic or drugs), and it remains aware of the first question you asked. If the target has been subject to <i>pillow talk</i> within the past week, the new spell fails. While your questions don&rsquo;t otherwise wake the target, this spell does nothing to prevent other sounds or stimulus from waking the target. A target who sleeps through the spellcasting and duration of the spell has no memory of it taking place, but a target who awakens before the spell ends remembers every question asked and what answers it gave.

Created by Ghorus when he was working to create the ghorans, <i>pinecone bomb</i> infuses a small pinecone with power, causing it to detonate with explosive force when thrown. You throw the pinecone at a target or point within range and it detonates immediately upon landing, dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 5d6) to each creature caught in the spread.

The subject temporarily ceases to feel the ill effects of a single ongoing affliction or condition from the following list: blinded, cursed, dazed, deafened, diseased, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, poisoned, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.

You create a hideous gray cloud, similar to <i><a href="#Fog Cloud">fog cloud</a></i>, that occasionally crackles with foul-smelling bolts of sickly green lightning. Creatures in the area must save or contract one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, demon fever, devil chills, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom (the disease is chosen by you when you cast the spell and applies to all creatures that fail the save). The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply) and is an instantaneous effect. Use the disease&rsquo;s listed frequency to determine further effects, but the disease&rsquo;s save DC increases by +2.
</p>

<p>
Unlike a <i>fog cloud</i>, the <i>plague storm</i> moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.
</p>

<p>
Figure out the cloud&rsquo;s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.
</p>

<p>
Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the terrain, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. The cloud cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

You draw motes of essence from material native to a plane that has elemental or energy essence traits (Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures 60), weaving the essence together into a shield of force. Choose an essence trait from the list below; the material component for this spell must come from a plane that has the essence trait you chose. Each essence trait has an associated damage type (see the table below). Any creature that hits you with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level you have (maximum +20) of a type corresponding to the essence trait you chose. In addition, you take only half damage from attacks or effects of the associated damage type, and if such an attack or effect allows a saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

<p>
By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity&rsquo;s choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature&rsquo;s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).
</p>

<p>
You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.
</p>

<p>
The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature&rsquo;s alignment and goals.
</p>

<p>
Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.
</p>

<p>
A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.
</p>

<p>
A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature&rsquo;s ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.
</p>

<p>
At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

<p>
Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell&rsquo;s range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.
</p>

<p>
To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual&rsquo;s proper name in casting the spell.
</p>

<p>
The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + &frac12; your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i><a href="#Magic Circle Against Evil">magic circle against evil</a></i>) to make the trap more secure.
</p>

<p>
If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature&rsquo;s Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell&rsquo;s effect and can escape or attack you.
</p>

<p>
Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
</p>

<p>
When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

Although he was hardly the first to turn to the Outer Planes for answers, Jatembe&rsquo;s dealings with outsiders in his pursuit of enlightenment are legendary, and the Magaambya credits the Old-Mage with the creation of this spell.
</p>

<p>
This spell calls a creature from another plane to your precise location, functioning like <i><a href="#Lesser Planar Ally">lesser planar ally</a></i> except as noted. When you call a creature using <i>planar inquiry</i>, the only task that you can ask of the creature is for it to answer questions or gather information regarding a specific topic (a person, a place, or a thing). After hearing your request, if the creature has an appropriate Knowledge skill, it can attempt a check to provide the information it has. If it lacks such a skill, the called creature leaves for 1d4 hours to gather this information. Upon its return, you roll 1d20 + your caster level, and use the result to determine what information the creature has gathered about the subject (as if using Diplomacy). The called creature stays for up to 10 minutes as it relays this information to you, after which it departs to its home plane. If the creature is attacked or damaged at any time during the spell&rsquo;s duration, the spell ends and the creature returns to the plane from which you summoned it.
</p>

<p>
When you cast this spell, you can choose a specific kind of outsider to call, even calling an individual creature by name. The kind of outsider called doesn&rsquo;t alter the effects of the spell, but when you use <i>planar inquiry</i> to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, the spell gains that descriptor. You cannot call an outsider whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level (maximum 18 HD) and you cannot use this spell to contact a unique outsider (such as a deity&rsquo;s herald) or an outsider with mythic ranks.

This spell helps creatures accustomed to the concrete reality of the Material Plane to navigate within the confusing realities of other planes. When cast, it functions as <i><a href="#Know Direction">know direction</a></i>, save that instead of revealing true north, it reveals the direction of the palace or demesnes most associated with that plane or demiplane&rsquo;s ruling god or demigod, as well as a brief and generic vision of that entity&rsquo;s appearance or holy symbol. The spell functions only within whatever plane or demiplane you are located in at the time; for instance, if cast within a specific demon lord&rsquo;s Abyssal realm or on a given layer of Hell, it would point to the seat of power for that demon lord or archdevil, not Lamashtu or Asmodeus. If a plane or demiplane has multiple gods or rulers, such as the Eldest of the First World or Heaven&rsquo;s various Empyreal Lords and deities, it reveals the directions of the closest three, allowing for triangulation.
</p>

<p>
This spell reveals the location of the god or demigod&rsquo;s official seat of power only, not the entity itself, and if such a location is deliberately hidden via magic of any sort, the spell automatically fails. It does not function on the Material Plane.

This spell enforces the rules of the Material Plane on other planes of existence. Upon casting this spell on another plane, a spherical pocket of wilderness terrain forms around the designated point. The affected area defies the local climate and planar traits, suppressing any harmful environmental effects such as toxicity, extreme temperatures, or lack of air (though this spell doesn&rsquo;t affect gravity). The area also becomes lush with edible plants whose appearance, taste, and smell bear characteristics distinct to the environment. On a negative-dominant planeGMG, for example, the plants grow ghastly white leaves and taste bitter. Though <i>planar refuge</i> can be cast on any plane of existence other than the Material Plane, it requires a body of solid matter at least as large as its area to function.
</p>

<p>
<i>Planar refuge</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell cast by a caster of 11th level or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the <i>plane shift</i> at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. <i>Plane shift</i> transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting <i>plane shift</i> again).

The magic of your allies in the area becomes more potent against certain outsiders. Choose one alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). Against outsiders with that alignment component or subtype, your allies in the area gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance, and their spells ignore the first 10 points of energy resistance (but not energy immunity).

This spell gains the alignment descriptor that is opposite the outsider alignment chosen. For example, if you choose for the spell to affect evil outsiders, then this spell has the good descriptor.

This spell increases the effectiveness of a planned action. If the targets spend at least 1 minute studying a situation, they receive bonuses to their first actions in response to the situation. All targets must declare in advance what their intended actions are. If they perform those actions, they receive a +2 sacred bonus to AC, saving throws, and checks for the first round. This bonus increases to +4 at 10th level and +6 at 15th level.
</p>

<p>
For example, the PCs discover a camp of orcs; the PC cleric casts <i>planned assault</i>, the group spends 1 minute analyzing the layout of the camp, and then declares its actions. As long as the PCs stick to the plan, they gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC, saving throws, and all actions for the first round.

This spell does not cause the plant creature to be predisposed toward you in any way, but allows you to interact with them with Charisma-based skills normally. Plant creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can communicate and understand only the simplest of concepts, such as &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; &ldquo;food,&rdquo; and &ldquo;danger.&rdquo; This spell has no effect on ordinary plants and fungus.

<p>
You must sacrifice a creature just as you finish casting this spell. When the sacrifice dies, its blood or ichor pools and hardens into a single red bloodstone. This bloodstone contains the essence and spirit of the sacrificed creature, allowing anyone holding the stone to activate the creature&rsquo;s highest-level activated racial spell-like ability, taking the actions necessary to activate the stored spell-like ability. Any creature who holds the stone can activate it, but the stone can be used only once per day (or the frequency of the creature&rsquo;s spell-like ability, whichever is less). If a creature has several racial spell-like abilities of the same spell level, choose randomly from among them to determine which one is stored in the bloodstone. The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like <i>invisibility</i> (self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for <i>greater teleport</i> (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing <i>summon monster II</i> (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can&rsquo;t store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp.
</p>

<p>
The save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as controlling the target of <i>dominate person</i>. The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round&rsquo;s worth of actions.
</p>

<p>
If the sacrificed creature doesn&rsquo;t die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power. The fragment of the creature&rsquo;s spirit trapped in the bloodstone does not hinder attempts to restore the creature to life.

A target that decides to attempt the Will save and succeeds is healed for half (as <i>cure serious wounds</i>) and negates the toxin. Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round&rsquo;s damage and end the affliction.

Illumination conditions are dropped by two steps (though only to darkness, not supernatural darkness), and all creatures in the area take 5d6 points of cold damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage per round.

If the target of the spell does not have physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), this spell grants a base score of 10 to each missing ability score. If the target of the spell does not have mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), this spell grants a score of 5 to such scores. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force. A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren&rsquo;t affected by this spell.

<p>
You attempt to possess a creature by projecting your soul into its body. The target creature must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body appears to be dead. Failure to take over a host ends the spell.
</p>

<p>
If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body. The host&rsquo;s soul is imprisoned with you, but can still use its own senses (though it can&rsquo;t assert any influence or use even purely mental abilities). You can communicate telepathically with the host as if you shared a common language, but only with your consent. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs doesn&rsquo;t allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can&rsquo;t activate the body&rsquo;s extraordinary or supernatural abilities, nor can you cast any of its spells or spell-like abilities.
</p>

<p>
As a standard action, you can shift freely back to your own body regardless of range, so long as it remains on the same plane. If the host&rsquo;s body is killed, you return to your own body and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If your body is slain, when the spell expires or the host&rsquo;s body is killed, you are slain. It is possible to cast this spell on a new target from within another creature&rsquo;s body; this resets the duration. You still return to your original body (not any intermediate body) when you take a standard action to do so or the spell&rsquo;s duration expires. Returning to your body ends the spell. Creatures whose souls are their bodies, such as incorporeal undead and non-native outsiders, use the effects of <i><a href="#Greater Possession">greater possession</a></i> instead.

<p>
You place a protective ward over your spirit that ensnares creatures attempting to possess you. Should a creature attempt to possess you (such as via <i>magic jar</i> or a similar effect) while you are under the effects of <i>possession trap</i>, that creature must first succeed at a Will save or its possession attempt is ruined and its spirit is shunted into this spell&rsquo;s focus gem. The trapped creature is contained within the focus gem for 1 round per caster level, acting as though it were trapped in a <i><a href="#Magic Jar">magic jar</a></i> for the duration of this effect. This effect fails if you are not carrying the focus gem during the time of the possession attempt.
</p>

<p>
If the possessor&rsquo;s Will save is successful, you are affected by its possession attempt as normal, and may attempt a saving throw against this possession attempt if one is normally allowed. Regardless of whether the possessor fails or succeeds at its save against <i>possession trap</i>, you immediately become aware of the possession attempt and whether or not a creature is trapped in the focus gem. If the focus gem is destroyed while it contains a creature, the creature is immediately released.
</p>

<p>
Once this spell is triggered, it offers no further protection, and a trapped creature can attempt to possess you again once it&rsquo;s free of the focus gem.

<p>
You curse the target to attract negative assumptions and rumors of a sort you specify when you cast the spell. If the target fails the initial save to negate the curse, every day that it spends in a settlement, it must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it accidentally says or does something that makes others assume the rumor you specified is true in some way that is unflattering or incriminating. If the creature is not aware of the nature of the rumors, it takes a &minus;4 penalty on these secondary saves. After the first failed save, the attitude each resident in the settlement has regarding the target is worsened by one step. For each additional failure, the target becomes the victim of focused harassment. A group of residents taunts or attacks the creature, potentially sending the authorities to investigate if the rumor indicates criminal guilt.
</p>

<p>
The spell can be cast at any distance. The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection you have to that creature. The target gains the same bonuses and penalties on its Will save to resist this spell as the bonuses and penalties that apply to the <i><a href="#Scrying">scrying</a></i> spell (including a +5 bonus if the target is on another plane), except that you can&rsquo;t cast <i>pox of rumors</i> without at least a possession or garment to use as the material component, and the target takes no penalty when you use a possession or garment and only a &minus;5 penalty when you use a piece of the target&rsquo;s body. <i>Pox of rumors</i> is a curse, and until its duration expires, it can be removed only by <i>remove curse</i> or similar magic.

The target&rsquo;s tail moves and acts more quickly, almost with a mind of its own. When making a full-attack action, the target may use its tail to make a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver as a swift action.

If the target already has an extra attack from <i>haste</i> or a similar effect, this spell only allows the tail to make dirty trick and steal combat maneuvers, but does not grant an extra attack.

You imbue one or more objects with magic that dramatically slows down natural processes that lead to decay and spoilage. For the duration of the spell, food, water, plants, and other perishable objects affected by the spell remain as fresh as they were when the spell was cast. The spell also protects these objects against spells of the same level or lower that cause spoilage, such as <i>putrefy food and drink</i>. When the duration of <i>preserve</i> expires, the objects resume aging at their normal rate.

The Lantern Bearers must often make difficult decisions during their missions, such as determining what to do with captured enemies&mdash;should they be executed, imprisoned, set free, or given a chance to mend their ways? With this spell, you grant a creature the ability to foresee moral consequences, as if the creature were wearing a <i>phylactery of faithfulness</i>. The spell&rsquo;s guidance focuses on the protection of beauty and encourages peaceful resolution and mercy.

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

This spell sequesters the targets&rsquo; ability for higher reasoning, allowing their darker impulses to come to the fore. An affected target becomes a ravening monster&mdash;savage, bloodthirsty, and brutish. Until the spell ends, the targets have all of the following benefits and drawbacks.
<ul>
	<li>	Targets&rsquo; Intelligence and Charisma scores drop to 3 (if the scores were higher), and they are unable to use Intelligence-or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently.
	<li>	Targets take a &minus;4 penalty on Will saves.
	<li>	Targets gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, and 2d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear at the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration. 
</ul>
When the spell ends, each affected creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.

You can pass into and out of the <i>prismatic sphere</i> and remain near it without harm.

<i>Prismatic wall</i> creates a vertical, opaque wall&mdash;a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. Any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded by the colors for 2d4 rounds if it looks at the wall.
</p>

<p>
The wall&rsquo;s maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A <i>prismatic wall</i> spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.
</p>

<p>
Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.
</p>

<p>
The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by casting the specified spells on the wall; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A <i>rod of cancellation</i> or a mage&rsquo;s disjunction spell destroys a <i>prismatic wall</i>, but an <i>antimagic field</i> fails to penetrate it. <i>Dispel magic</i> and <i>greater dispel magic</i> can only be used on the wall once all the other colors have been destroyed. Spell resistance is effective against a <i>prismatic wall</i>, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.
</p>

<p>
<i>Prismatic wall</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

You gain a glimpse of a potential reality similar to this one but that never was. If the target fails her Will save, you can ask about one topic and attempt the appropriate Knowledge check with a +5 competence bonus; track Knowledge checks attempted with this spell separately for the purpose of disallowing retries on Knowledge checks. You learn information on that topic from a reality in which you were an acquaintance of the target, although the differences in that reality might cause the answer to be subtly different than in your own. Once you have probed a target&rsquo;s history, successfully or not, you cannot target the same creature&rsquo;s history or search for the same information in another creature&rsquo;s history.

<p>
Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment.
</p>

<p>
In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.
</p>

This spell does not function underwater.

You are surrounded by a nimbus of shadow shaped like your god&rsquo;s unholy symbol or a symbol of your faith. Any good creature striking you with unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell resistance applies against this damage. You also take half damage from magical attacks with the good descriptor. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action).
</p>

<p>
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.
</p>

<p>
If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The projected image can&rsquo;t cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image.
</p>

<p>
Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had succeeded on their Will save. You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use <i>dimension door</i>, <i>teleport</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

You curse the target with the weaknesses of your kind of vampirism. The creature reacts to garlic, mirrors, ringing bells, sunlight, and so on as if it were a vampire of the same type as you. This cannot kill the target; anything that would kill it (such as a lengthy exposure to sunlight if you are a moroi vampire) renders it helpless until the curse or the harmful effect is removed. The target gains none of the benefits of being a vampire (such as fast healing or requiring special ways to be permanently killed), only the penalties.

You call to mind prophecies regarding a person, place, item, or event. These might be predictions made in the past, lost to history, or entirely new. If the person or item is present or if you are at the desired location, the casting time is 1d4×10 minutes; if you have general but specific information about the subject, the casting time is 1d4×2 hours.

The targeted room is enchanted to have magical appeal for customers, an increase in the workflow of its employees, or the generation of additional materials to work with.

If the room produces multiple types of capital, it produces an additional capital of each type. If the room generates gp, it generates 25% more. Only the capital that the room normally generates increases&mdash;rooms that do not already generate Magic, for instance, do not generate Magic because of this spell.

While this spell is in effect, neither you nor your allies can further interact with the affected room or the spell&rsquo;s effects immediately end.

<p>
This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.
</p>

<p>
First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.
</p>

<p>
Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment &#91;charm&#93; effects and enchantment &#91;compulsion&#93; effects such as <i>charm person</i>, <i>command</i>, and <i>dominate person</i>). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect.
</p>

<p>
If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires.
</p>

<p>
While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target.
</p>

<p>
This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using <i>magic> jar</i>), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.
</p>

<p>
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

This spell wards a creature from attacks by outsiders with a specific racial subtype, from mental control exerted by creatures of the chosen subtype, and from summoned creatures of that subtype. Only the subtypes of specific outsider races&mdash;angel, azata, demon, oni, psychopomp, protean, and so on&mdash;can be chosen as the subtype this spell protects against. Alignment subtypes or other general subtypes (like elemental, extraplanar, or native) cannot be selected. Outsiders without an outsider racial subtype (like genies, night hags, yeth hounds, or xills) are not affected by this spell.
</p>

<p>
This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.
</p>

<p>
First, the subject gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves when targeted by creatures of the chosen subtype.
</p>

<p>
Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the target creature. This functions in the same fashion as <i><a href="#Protection from Evil">protection from evil</a></i>, but only when the effect stems from outsiders of the chosen subtype, and the target&rsquo;s saving throw is made with a +4 morale bonus (using the same DC as the original effect).
</p>

<p>
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures of the chosen subtype in the same manner as detailed in <i>protection from evil</i>.
</p>

<p>
This spell&rsquo;s descriptor varies depending on the outsider race selected, gaining the alignment descriptors opposite to the alignment of the outsider race&mdash;for example, lawful and good if the race is chaotic and evil, chaotic if the selected race is lawful, or none if the selected race is neutral.

With a touch, you bolster a creature&rsquo;s body to protect it from the harmful effects of spores and similar afflictions. While under the effect of this spell, a creature is immune to the effects of brown mold, green slime, russet mold, yellow mold, and any similar hazard, provided the hazard is CR 6 or lower. Similarly, the creature is immune to poison, disease, and infestation attacks from all fungal creatures of CR 6 or lower, including effects such as basidirond spores, violet fungus rot, and the like. The target is immune to fungus-based toxins, such as striped toadstool. Against similar hazards or monsters of CR 7 or higher, the target gains a bonus on all saving throws against the effect equal to half your caster level. <i>Protection from spores</i> offers no protection against fungal infestations created by the seeded, by the spell <i>what grows within</i>, or by Xhamen-Dor.

This spell wards a creature from attacks by technological objects and creatures of the robot subtype, and protects against mental control from technological sources. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has two major effects.
</p>

<p>
First, the target gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects caused by technological objects and creatures with the robot subtype.
</p>

<p>
Second, the target immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any technological effects that exercise mental control over the creature, including the effects of pharmaceuticals such as torpinal. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on this saving throw, using the same DC as the original effect. If the target succeeds at this save, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to exercise mental control over her using technological means.

A <i>protective spirit</i> is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the <i>protective spirit</i> makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A <i>protective spirit</i> can defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.
</p>

<p>
A <i>protective spirit</i> occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>a sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>protective spirit</i>&rsquo;s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.

You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called &ldquo;eyes&rdquo;) equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.
</p>

<p>
While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they&rsquo;re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with a +20 bonus on Fly skill checks and a +16 bonus on Stealth skill checks. It has a Perception modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling in darkness must find its way by touch.
</p>

<p>
When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than 25 words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.
</p>

<p>
In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.
</p>

<p>
If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won&rsquo;t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.
</p>

<p>
The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. <i>Dispel magic</i> can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

<p>
You retreat into a mindscape of your own making that allows you to perform a lengthy mental task in an instant. You create a mental landscape that provides succor and calm for you, such as a library, sitting room, garden, or childhood tree house. You can spend up to 15 minutes in your <i>psychic asylum</i>. While you are within, no time passes for your body, and when you emerge you can continue with your turn. The mindscape is overt, finite, and has a rapid passage of time.
</p>

<p>
While within the mindscape, you can consult any text, recall any conversation, or remember any image that you have been exposed to with perfect clarity and recollection, as if you had an eidetic memory. You must have seen or heard the material within a time frame of 1 week per level. For example, you might wish to reexamine a passage of text from an ancient manuscript you rapidly scanned in a library 2 weeks prior. While in the <i>psychic asylum</i>, you can perfectly recall the precise layout of the text within the ancient manuscript and read it word for word. Once you emerge from the <i>psychic asylum</i>, you can recall the details of what you had just studied as clearly as if you had just looked at it, but you no longer have total recall of the material.
</p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re able to prepare spells, you can use the time to prepare a single spell. For example, if you were poisoned, you could use your swift action to cast <i>psychic asylum</i>, pray and meditate for the full 15 minutes to gain <i>neutralize poison</i>, then emerge from the mindscape and immediately cast the spell upon yourself as your standard action.
</p>

<p>
Any mind-affecting spell that was affecting you before you cast the spell continues to expend its duration on you while you are within the <i>psychic asylum</i>, so you can use this spell to wait out the effects of such a condition. Effects that are currently affecting your body do not expend additional duration while you are in the <i>psychic asylum</i>, but you also don&rsquo;t experience their effects during the time spent there.

Using your psychic power, you invade the mind of the target and tear it asunder, causing massive internal damage to both its mind and body. If the target succeeds at the initial Will save, it is sickened for 1 round. If the target fails its Will save, it must attempt a Fortitude save (with a +4 circumstance bonus on this save if it has more than half its total hit points remaining). If it also fails the Fortitude save, the target is reduced to &minus;1 hit points and is dying. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level, which cannot reduce the target below &minus;1 hit point, and the target is sickened for 1 round. This attack has no effect on creatures without an Intelligence score.

You envelop your consciousness in a quasi-real image of yourself. Your <i>psychic image</i> looks, sounds, and smells like you, but is intangible. While your mind occupies the image, you control it as though it were your own body, but you cannot directly affect physical objects. Your image moves with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. Your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear while occupying it, and your own body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless. You can switch between the image and your body as a swift action. While your mind is in your body, the image is similarly helpless.
</p>

<p>
Your image can pass through solid objects as though you are incorporeal. It cannot go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Small or Medium creature). It can&rsquo;t be damaged by most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures. However, mind-affecting effects targeted against or affecting your <i>psychic image</i> have their full effect on you whenever your mind occupies it.
</p>

<p>
If you desire, you can cast any psychic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater while your mind occupies your image. You can&rsquo;t cast non-psychic spells through the image, even if you possess them. The <i>psychic image</i> can cast only psychic illusion spells on itself. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the <i>psychic image</i>.
</p>

<p>
Objects are affected by the <i>psychic image</i> as if they had succeeded at their Will saves. You need not maintain line of effect to your <i>psychic image</i>, but if you cross into another plane even for an instant, such as via <i>blink</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, or similar spells, the spell ends.

A successful skill check reveals to you one of the following pieces of information of your choice, plus one additional piece of information for every 5 points by which your check result exceeds 20: age, alignment, class&#8224;, feats&#8224;, gender, native language, place of origin, race or ethnicity, racial traits&#8224;, religion, sexual orientation, or training in a Craft, Perform, or Profession skill. For items marked with a cross (&#8224;), if the target has more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as a piece of information.
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s a 70% chance that all information you receive is correct. This roll is made secretly. Otherwise, on a roll of 71&ndash;80, you receive one false piece of information, on a roll of 81&ndash;90 you receive two, and on a roll of 91&ndash;100 you receive three. You can&rsquo;t get more false information than the total number of pieces of information you discover.

<i>Psychic surgery</i> cures the target of all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage and restores all points permanently drained from the target&rsquo;s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also eliminates all ongoing insanity, confusion, and fear effects. <i>Psychic surgery</i> can also remove other mental afflictions, including enchantment spells and abilities, and even instantaneous effects, but in this case, if <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i> couldn&rsquo;t remove the effect, psychic surgery works only if the spell level or equivalent spell level of the effect was 6th level or lower. <i>Psychic surgery</i> removes all effects magically altering the target&rsquo;s memory, even instantaneous effects, and it can restore a memory to perfect clarity like the second use of <i><a href="#Modify Memory">modify memory</a></i>.

You take a mental journey through the doors of perception to enter an altered state of consciousness. Despite this hallucinatory transmigration being entirely unreal, your mind and body fully react to it. You gain a +4 alchemical bonus to a random ability score, as well as a corresponding &minus;2 penalty. If the bonus applies to Strength, the penalty applies to Intelligence, and vice versa. If the bonus applies to Dexterity, the penalty applies to Wisdom, and vice versa. If the bonus applies to Constitution, the penalty applies to Charisma, and vice versa. Each round as a standard action, you can explore the nooks and crannies of your imagination to further alter your corporal self. If you do so, attempt a Will save against the spell&rsquo;s save DC. If you succeed, randomly select another ability score and change the alchemical bonus and associated penalty accordingly. If you fail, you are dazed for 1 round instead as your mind reels from learning unexpected truths about yourself.

<p>
Hated by adventurers throughout the Inner Sea region, the gremlins known as pugwampis infect those around them with a malignant form of unluck&mdash;an effect that this spell emulates. If the target fails its Will save, it becomes infused with the so-called &ldquo;grace of the pugwampi.&rdquo; A creature affected by this spell must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results generated. As with the aura shed by actual pugwampies, this spell has no effect on animals, gremlins, or gnolls. The effects of this spell are negated as long as a target gains any sort of luck bonus to a d20 roll (such as those granted by a <i>luckstone</i> or <i>divine favor</i>), but the spell&rsquo;s duration is not impacted by these effects. If the luck bonus goes away before the pugwampi&rsquo;s grace effect ends, the unluck returns and remains until the spell&rsquo;s normal duration runs out.

You transform the subject animal into a Small magical beast (or a magical beast one size category smaller than the original creature, whichever is smaller), creating a young magical version of itself for a short period of time. While in this form, the target has only 1 HD (maximum hit points), and the target takes a &minus;4 penalty to Strength, Constitution, Intelligence and Wisdom (minimum 1). The creature also gains a +4 size bonus to Dexterity and a +2 natural armor bonus.
</p>

<p>
Any nonevil creature that attempts to attack a creature in this form must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the DC of the spell) to overcome feelings of guilt and protectiveness toward the young and innocent-seeming creature. On a failed saving throw, it cannot follow through with the attack, that part of the action is lost, and it can&rsquo;t directly attack the transformed creature for the duration of the spell or until the spell&rsquo;s target attacks it. This part of the spell is a mind-affecting emotion effect. Evil creatures have no qualms about attacking the target of this spell, in fact, some particularly heinous creatures might go out of their ways to do the target harm.

This spell causes even commonly used objects to become conundrums. When cast on a creature, the target loses all weapon and shield proficiencies. The target also forgets how to use all spell-completion, spell-trigger, and use-activated magic items, as well as any mundane items used as part of a skill check, imposing a &minus;5 penalty on all ability and skill checks attempted with such items. These effects last for 1 round per level. As a move action, the target can attempt a skill check to negate the effects of this spell for one object. Weapons, shields, and mundane objects require a successful Craft skill check of the type required to craft the item in question, with a DC equal to the spell&rsquo;s save DC. Magic items require a successful Spellcraft or Use Magic Device skill check against the spell&rsquo;s save DC.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a single touched object that weighs up to 5 pounds per the caster&rsquo;s level. Use of this object becomes a puzzle even to those previously familiar with it. Any creature attempting to use an item affected in this way is treated as though the creature was the target of <i>puzzle box</i> for that item only. When cast on an object, the duration of this spell is permanent.

The caster causes jets of flame to erupt from the ground and surround the target.

The blaze surrounds the target for the duration of the spell, forcing the creature to attempt a new save each round. Each round, the damage dealt is reduced to half as many d6; the spell expires when it would deal no damage. If the target moves, the <i>pyrotechnic eruption</i> follows, even if the target teleports.

Anyone attempting to touch the target takes damage, using the same amount of dice as the last time the target attempted a save (Reflex half). A creature can take the place of the target by bull rushing or grappling it and switching places.

You reduce the target creature&rsquo;s ability to tap into a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) of your choice.

Damage from sources other than the creature, such as objects and magic items, is not reduced.

<i>Quench</i> is often used to put out forest fires and other conflagrations. It extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area.  The spell also dispels any fire spells in its area, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.
</p>

<p>
Each creature with the fire subtype within the area of a <i>quench</i> spell takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6, no save allowed).
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame. The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless it succeeds on a Will save. Artifacts are immune to this effect.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Arcane Eye.htm">arcane eye</a></i>, except that it uses an <i>ioun stone</i> as a visible scrying sensor. The <i>ioun stone</i> moves at the same rate as an <i>arcane eye</i>, and may pass through holes or spaces as small as 2 inches in diameter. It can enter another plane of existence using a <i>gate</i> or similar portal, but the caster loses contact with the sensor should this occur. The enhanced <i>ioun stone</i> has AC 24, 10 hp, hardness 5, fly speed 30 (perfect), and a +16 Stealth bonus. The stone does not provide you with its normal benefits while you are using it as a scrying sensor.

Those under the effects of this spell become faster in the use of thrown weapons.

The target weapons and any ammunition they fire make no sound as part of their normal functions as a weapon. For instance, a firearm&rsquo;s firing would not make an explosive sound, but if you cast this spell on a creature&rsquo;s bite attack, it would not prevent it from vocalizing from its mouth. The first time a creature is struck by a weapon affected by this spell, it must succeed at a Will save (SR applies to this effect) or it becomes unable to make noise louder than a whisper (Perception DC 10 to hear) whether vocally or by other means for the duration of the effect. Because the creature can still whisper, this doesn&rsquo;t interfere with verbal spell components. Whether it succeeds or fails its saving throw, the creature is immune to further effects from this casting of <i>quieting weapons</i>.

You draw forth the idealized image of the target creature or object, masking any flaws or damage. An injured or ill creature appears healthy, and a damaged object or one with the broken condition appears intact. However, a corpse masked by <i>quintessence</i> remains obviously dead, and a completely destroyed object can&rsquo;t be made to seem whole. This illusion has visual and tactile components. Careful examination of or handling the target grants a saving throw to disbelieve, but casual observation does not. Using a broken object for its intended purpose automatically reveals the deception. Appraise checks to assess the value of an object affected by <i>quintessence</i> estimate the value as an item of its type in perfect condition, unless the appraiser disbelieves the illusion.
</p>

<p>
Unwilling targets can negate the spell&rsquo;s effect on them with successful Will saves or with spell resistance. Those who interact with the target can attempt Will saves to see through the glamer, but spell resistance doesn&rsquo;t apply. <i>Quintessence</i> counters and dispels <i>decrepit disguise</i>.

This spell grants the caster limited control over the quintessence of an Outer Plane.

The total spell levels of effects to be created must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>secure shelter</i>, and <i>soften earth and stone</i> (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or <i>diminish plants</i> and <i>spike stones</i> (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not <i>move earth</i> and <i>plant growth</i> (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level&mdash;<i>control water</i>, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it&rsquo;s a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended.

At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, additional restrictions beyond those listed in the create demiplane spell may limit this spell&rsquo;s effects, and additional options for customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for 1 day per caster level. This version of <i>quintessence mastery</i> can be made permanent in the same way and for the same cost as create demiplane.

A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within it. <i>Rainbow pattern</i> fascinates a maximum of 24 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell&rsquo;s point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern.
</p>

<p>
With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the <i>rainbow pattern</i> move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked, creatures who can&rsquo;t see them are no longer affected.

You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level. In addition, the subject&rsquo;s soul must be free and willing to return.
</p>

<p>
If the subject&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
</p>

<p>
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be raised). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised. A spellcasting creature that doesn&rsquo;t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.
</p>

<p>
A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature&rsquo;s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.
</p>

<p>
A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can&rsquo;t be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can&rsquo;t be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

You create a massive <i>rampart</i> of hard-packed earth and stone 5 feet thick. The <i>rampart</i> cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as another creature or object. Each 5-foot-wide section of the <i>rampart</i> has hardness 0 and 180 hit points. A section of the <i>rampart</i> whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the <i>rampart</i> with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 60. A creature can climb over the <i>rampart</i> with a DC 20 Climb check.

You can cast this spell only if it is the first action you take on your turn. In a burst of shadowy feathers, you turn into a Tiny blurred shape reminiscent of a black raven until the beginning of your next turn. You gain a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, and apply appropriate size modifiers (though your ability scores don&rsquo;t change). Until the beginning of your next turn, you can take only the 5-foot step, move, run, or withdraw actions. If the spell is dispelled while you are still aloft, the power of flight dissipates slowly; you float downward 60 feet on your next turn, then fall any remaining distance.

You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects&mdash;books, scrolls, weapons, and the like&mdash;that would otherwise be unintelligible.

<i>Recorporeal incarnation</i> effectively replaces the target living creature&rsquo;s body with that of the target corpse. The target corpse must be fresh&mdash;either dead for no more than 24 hours or appropriately preserved by an effect such as <i>gentle repose</i>. While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while touching the living target with the focus item. As the spell is cast, the dead body&rsquo;s flesh unravels like ribbons to sheathe the living target, who must be within one size category of the corpse. While the spell is in effect, the focus item must remain within 30 feet of the target living creature.
</p>

<p>
The living target gains the physical appearance and size of the corpse, and gains its abilities as defined in <i><a href="#Alter Self">alter self</a></i> as well as any immunities, weapon proficiencies, weaknesses, and spell resistance the dead target had while living. The living target gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the individual whose corpse is targeted by this spell. The disguise created by <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> lasts for a number of weeks equal to your caster level, or until the focus item is moved more than 30 feet away from the living target. When the effect ends, the living target returns to its normal form, sloughing off the corpse&rsquo;s flesh.
</p>

<p>
The greatest strength of <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> is the difficulty of detecting it as a disguise. If subjected to <i>detect magic</i>, the living target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives off an aura of strong necromantic magic. <i>True seeing</i> does not reveal the living target&rsquo;s true form, since the corpse&rsquo;s flesh magically obscures it. The spell <i>detect undead</i> and similar effects indicate the living target is an undead creature, but the target is not truly undead, and is not affected by any other effects that target undead creatures. <i>Recorporeal incarnation</i> does not disguise the target&rsquo;s alignment.
</p>

<p>
If the living target of <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues. Any <i>raise dead</i> or similar spell cast upon that target resurrects that target, not the corpse flesh. Since <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> destroys the majority of the target corpse&rsquo;s physical remains, the target corpse cannot be restored to life except by <i>miracle</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>, or <i>wish</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Recorporeal incarnation</i> can be made permanent by a 15th-level caster using <i>permanency</i> with a material component worth 17,500 gp.

The killer&rsquo;s right hand becomes stained indelibly red, and this stain can&rsquo;t be removed (although it can be hidden by magical or mundane means, such as <i>disguise self</i> or by wearing gloves).

<p>
This spell affects only the creature that directly killed the targeted corpse. Other individuals that contributed to the target&rsquo;s death are unaffected, and if the victim did not die from violence or died indirectly (for instance, if the creature died from suffocating after someone trapped it in a room filling with water), then the spell has no effect. The killer can attempt a Will save to resist the spell&rsquo;s effects. Distance is not a factor, but the killer must be on the same plane as you at the time you cast the spell, or the spell fails. Once a corpse has acted as the focus for <i>red hand of the killer</i>, it can never act as the focus for another casting of <i>red hand of the killer</i>.

<p>
This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature&rsquo;s size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a &minus;2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size.
</p>

<p>
A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2&ndash;&frac12; feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent&rsquo;s square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn&rsquo;t change the target&rsquo;s speed.
</p>

<p>
All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.
</p>

<p>
Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any reduced item that leaves the reduced creature&rsquo;s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).
</p>

<p>
Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack. <i>Reduce person</i> counters and dispels <i>enlarge person</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Reduce person</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

In the blink of an eye, you erect a deflective barrier of force to protect one target. The target gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to half your caster level.

<p>
When you cast this spell, you create powerful magic in a specially prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is so enhanced, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character&rsquo;s heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar or animal companion that is touching the subject).
</p>

<p>
You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the <i>refuge</i> spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.

<p>
With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject&rsquo;s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.
</p>

<p>
Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature&rsquo;s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature&rsquo;s body at the time of death.
</p>

<p>
The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.
</p>

<p>
A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject&rsquo;s racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcreature that doesn&rsquo;t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s possible for the change in the subject&rsquo;s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.
</p>

<p>
For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the next page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.
</p>

<p>
A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can&rsquo;t be returned to life by this spell.
</p>

<p>
Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can&rsquo;t be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.

You exhale deeply, creating a gentle magical wind that invigorates any allies in the affected area, as follows. Any sleeping allies immediately wake up. Fascinated allies are shaken free of the fascinate effect. Flat-footed allies no longer count as flat-footed even if they have not acted yet. The duration of effects that cause any allies to be confused, frightened, paralyzed, slowed, or stunned is decreased by 1d4 rounds (roll separately for each target). If the duration of any such effect is reduced to 0 rounds or fewer, the effect ends for that ally. Finally, any allies lying prone may stand up as an immediate action, provoking attacks of opportunity as normal.

This spell summons a pack of canines that respond to the spellcaster&rsquo;s commands and act in perfect unison, causing them to function like a swarm. The pack uses the statistics for a winter wolf, except it loses its breath weapon, the cold subtype, and its cold special attack and gains the swarm subtype, a swarm attack that deals 3d6 points of damage, and the distraction special attack (DC 17). Whenever the pack damages an opponent with its swarm attack, it can immediately attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that creature with its trip special attack. The pack does not gain any damage reduction or immunity to damage and can be attacked by effects that target a specific number of creatures, though such attacks deal 1/4 the normal amount of damage (25%) and effects that don&rsquo;t deal hit point damage are only 25% likely to work.

Once per round, phantom hands load a single ranged weapon or firearm with conjured ammunition. This ammunition counts as magical for overcoming damage reduction and attacking incorporeal creatures, but is the standard for its type (a normal bullet or pellets and black powder in the case of firearms). Conjured ammunition ceases to exist 1 round after it is removed from the weapon, or at the end of the duration, whichever comes first.

While this spell is in effect, your body and clothing flutter and distort subtly, allowing you to conceal items with uncanny skill. You treat any object you can hold in one hand as a coin-sized object for the purposes of Sleight of Hand checks to palm the object or make it disappear; however, you can hide only one such item per caster level on your person at one time. This effect does not change the actual sizes of the objects.

Your body enters a trance as you send your psychic senses to a distant location and gain psychic impressions of that location. You must specify the distance and direction to the location you desire to view remotely. This spell doesn&rsquo;t allow you to see the visual appearance of the location&rsquo;s surface, so it isn&rsquo;t useful for casting spells like <i>teleport</i>, but it grants you a psychic impression of the location, which could give you deeper information. For example, a forest that is home to a tight-knit community of fey might appear as a city in the trees, or a beautiful palace ruled by an evil king and warded by <i>forbiddance</i> might appear as a dark fortress encased in insubstantial chains.
</p>

During the 1 hour casting time of <i>remote viewing</i>, your real body is unconscious and helpless, and you are unaware of its surroundings.

You remove all ongoing radiation effects, both primary and secondary, on a single target if you succeed at a caster level check (DC = the Fortitude DC associated with the radiation effect). In addition, you immediately restore 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Strength drain caused by radiation&mdash;this spell cannot restore ability damage or drain caused by other sources. When cast on an area, a single casting of <i>remove radioactivity</i> removes radiation from a 20-foot-radius area around the point you touch. This spell has no power to negate naturally radioactive materials, and as long as such materials remain in an area, the radiation that was removed may return.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Remove Radioactivity">remove radioactivity</a></i>, save that it cures all ability damage and drain due to radioactivity that the target has taken. In addition, you can deplete a radioactive object as well, although because you must touch the object to affect it, you expose yourself to at least 1 round of contact with the object&rsquo;s radiation. You must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 5 + the Fortitude DC associated with the radiation effect) in order to deplete the object. If you are successful, the object no longer emits radiation. In the case of a nuclear reactor or atomic warhead, this permanently renders the reactor or warhead inert and harmless.

You lacerate the body of the target creature with telekinetic force, rending it limb from limb. The target creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level you have (maximum 10d6 points of damage). If this spell deals an amount of damage to the target equal to more than half its maximum hit point total, one of the target&rsquo;s limbs (determined randomly) is gruesomely ripped from the target&rsquo;s body and flies 15 feet away from the creature in a random direction. The target then takes 1 point of bleed damage per 2 caster levels you have. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage, but the limb can be restored only by powerful healing effects such as <i>heal</i> or <i>regeneration</i>. If the damage reduces the target&rsquo;s hit points to below 0, all of its limbs are affected in this fashion.

Objects such as metal armor, swords, and the like are pushed back, dragging their bearers with them.

If a spear is planted (set) in a way that prevents this forced movement, it splinters.
</p>

<p>
Even magic items with wooden sections are repelled, although an <i>antimagic field</i> blocks the effects.
</p>

<p>
The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell&rsquo;s duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell&rsquo;s power.

This spell allows you to reconstruct past events that occurred in your current location based on the tracks and other signs left behind. <i>Replay tracks</i> reveals events that occurred while the tracks that serve as the focus for the spell were being left, revealing events in the order they happened in real time or in reverse, depending on whether you are following the tracks forward or backward, although the image isn&rsquo;t clear enough to make out details (such as a creature&rsquo;s exact identity). You can attempt Survival checks to follow tracks as part of concentrating on the spell, but only events connected to the tracks used as the focus of the spell are revealed by the spell. Elements that left no trace detectable by you, such as creatures benefitting from <i>pass without trace</i>, are absent from the events you visualize.

This spell allows you to safeguard important knowledge, even from yourself. When casting this spell, you recount one piece of knowledge you possess (up to a maximum of 50 words). This knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches omissions in your memory with indistinct haze <i>Repress memory</i> protects against <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>discern lies</i>, <i>zone of truth</i>, and similar spells, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in your memory, or that your memory has been affected by the spell.
</p>

<p>
A repressed memory can be restored only by <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>psychic surgery</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. If you use this spell to negate the memory of a magical compulsion, it doesn&rsquo;t remove the compulsion, nor does it remove procedural memories that might affect your skills or class abilities.
</p>

<p>
At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, multiple castings of this spell might erase memories of a lengthier event or all memory of a place or individual from your memory.

<p>
You cast the target out of your religion as a curse and punishment for acts or misdeeds against the tenets of your faith. This has three effects.
</p>

<p>
First, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark).
</p>

<p>
Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, <i>cure light wounds</i> cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast <i>prayer</i>, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target&rsquo;s friendship with the cleric.
</p>

<p>
Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.
</p>

<p>
This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges.
</p>

<p>
This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.
</p>

<p>
This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use <i>atonement</i> to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; <i>remove curse</i> also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the <i>reprobation</i>.

An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting (to the limit your level allows). Any creature within or entering the field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures&rsquo; actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons.
</p>

<p>
If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. The creature is not forced back. The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell&rsquo;s area.

This spell creates a magical well of retribution that a caster can unleash with blinding speed.
</p>

<p>
Upon casting this spell, damage from melee attacks and touch spells gets transferred into a special pool that you then redirect before the spell&rsquo;s duration expires.
</p>

<p>
Each time you are struck by a melee attack or touch spell that deals hit point damage, 1 point of damage is negated and transferred into the reservoir created by this spell. The total number of points in the reservoir cannot exceed your caster level (to a maximum of 20 points at 20th level). As an immediate action, anytime before the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, you can release some or all of the energy of the reservoir, granting yourself an insight bonus on one skill check, attack roll, damage roll, or combat maneuver check, but you must do so before the roll is made. This bonus is equal to the number of points in the reservoir. For every five caster levels, you may call upon the reservoir one additional time (maximum of four times at 15th level).
</p>

<p>
If you are reduced to negative hit points while you are under the effect of this spell, the spell automatically release the remaining magic of the reservoir in a concussive blast of force. All creatures within a 15-foot radius take 1d6 points of force damage per 2 points remaining in the reserve (maximum of 10d6). A successful Reflex save halves this damage, and spell resistance applies to this effect.

Additionally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to initiate a grapple, maintain a grapple, and pin a foe. Any enemy you grapple takes a &minus;2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape the grapple using Escape Artist. Any weapon, that strikes you becomes stuck unless its wielder succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. Such a weapon can be pulled free of you only with a successful Strength check (DC = your saving throw DC for this spell). This spell has no effect on unarmed strikes or natural weapons.

This abjuration grants a creature limited <i>protection</i> from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains <i>resist energy</i> 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature&rsquo;s hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient&rsquo;s equipment as well.

<p>
This spell creates a towering mansion. While casting the spell, you hold an image of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and is decorated to match your image. You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally.
</p>

<p>
A <i>resplendent mansion</i> contains the same types of foodstuffs and servants as a mage&rsquo;s magnificent mansion.
</p>

<p>
Each of the mansion&rsquo;s exterior doorways and windows are protected by <i><a href="#Alarm">alarm</a></i> spells. You choose whether each <i>alarm</i> is audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each <i>alarm</i> has a different sound (for an audible <i>alarm</i>) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.
</p>

<p>
The mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting all structural requirements for being built on, for example, a mountainside. The mansion adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can&rsquo;t be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there&rsquo;s a 10% chance each day that the mansion begins to sink or collapse.
</p>

<p>
The mansion doesn&rsquo;t harm creatures within the area when it appears, and can&rsquo;t be created among a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the mansion when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the complete mansion.

A cloak you are wearing transforms into a canvas tent large enough to hold four Medium creatures, firmly pitched in a flat area adjacent to you (if there is no such area, this spell simply fails). A creature regains 1 hit point for each hour it rests in the tent, in addition to any other benefits of resting. Additionally, a fatigued creature resting within the tent for 1 hour loses the fatigued condition, but a creature cannot recover from being fatigued more than once per casting of <i>restful cloak</i>. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the tent transforms back into a cloak. If the tent is moved prior to the expiration of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the spell immediately ends.

You cast this spell immediately prior to resting. While under the effects of this spell, you and your allies enjoy a restful night&rsquo;s sleep. If a subject completes a full night&rsquo;s rest, it regains hit points as if it had undergone a full day of bed rest (regaining twice its character level in hit points). If a subject completes a full day&rsquo;s rest, it regains three times its character level in hit points. Any significant interruption during the rest (such as being awoken) prevents any healing that night and ends the effect of this spell on the awakened subject. Any healing acquired while under the effects of <i>restful sleep</i> is considered natural healing, and has no affect on effects requiring magical healing to cure.

<i>Resurgent transformation</i> grants you the ability to recover from deadly wounds with restored vitality and a will to fight, but at a price. Once cast, <i>resurgent transformation</i> lies dormant for up to 1 hour per level until you are reduced to one-quarter hit points or less. Once triggered, you immediately gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Strength, damage reduction 5/&mdash;, and the benefits of a <i>haste</i> spell. In addition, you heal 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). <i>Resurgent transformation</i> can even save you from death by healing the damage from an otherwise mortal wound, though it does not prevent death from massive damage or from causes other than hit point loss. Your mental faculties are impaired by this magical transformation, however, causing 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage.
</p>

<p>
The advantages from your transformation persist for 1 round per caster level after the spell is triggered. Once the spell ends, it takes a heavy toll, leaving you exhausted and inflicting 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Utilizing more than one <i>resurgent transformation</i> in a day is particularly risky.
</p>

<p>
The expiration of a second <i>resurgent transformation</i> in a 24-hour period inflicts an additional 1d4 points of Constitution damage and results in death from system shock unless you succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, made after the Constitution damage has been applied.
</p>

<p>
If the spell expires or is dispelled before the transformation has been triggered, no adverse effects result.

<p>
The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature&rsquo;s body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature&rsquo;s body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a <i>disintegrate</i> spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level.
</p>

<p>
Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells.
</p>

<p>
The subject of the spell gains one permanent negative level when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be resurrected).

If a creature successfully takes the item targeted by this spell while you are holding, wearing, or wielding it, the creature must attempt a Will save. If the creature fails its save, it becomes fatigued, and it must attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn every round it does not return the item to you. Failing a second saving throw causes the target to become exhausted. As long as the victim of the curse is actively working to return the object, its exhaustion is reduced to fatigue. The fatigue and exhaustion cannot be removed by effects that normally remove them, though immunity to fatigue and exhaustion protect against the conditions as normal.

This spell allows you to gain psychic impressions from past events that occurred in your current location. <i>Retrocognition</i> reveals psychic impressions from events that occurred over the course of the last hour throughout the first minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next hour back the next minute you concentrate, and so on. If a psychically traumatic or turbulent event happened during that time period, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20, 30, or 40, depending on the severity of the psychic disturbance) or lose concentration on the spell.

<p>
At caster level 13th and higher, you can choose to collect impressions from over the course of a longer interval of time than an hour, beginning at 1 week per minute of concentration (as listed on the table below). The amount of detail you receive diminishes, so this eventually makes it harder to distinguish impressions left by anything but the most major events.

You create an area that draws out a creature&rsquo;s emotion aura. Creatures within this area constantly glow with colors that represent their current overall emotional state and continue to do so for 1d4 rounds after leaving the area. This glow is clearly visible to any creature that can see the creature. Emotionless creatures or creatures unaffected by this spell glow with a dull purple hue while within the area.

You can focus upon a single point within line of sight and discern if the terrain or geographic features of that point are illusory. This ability allows you a Will save to disbelieve a terrain-affecting illusion (glamer) effect from range as though you had interacted with it. In addition to affecting such spells as <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> and <i>mirage arcana</i>, this spell also allows you to disbelieve naturally occurring mirages.

When you cast this spell, you ask the target whether it has a secret about a specific topic that can be described in 10 words or fewer. This can concern a person, place, or thing (such as a town&rsquo;s mayor, the ring worn by a traveling merchant, or the bridge spanning a nearby river) or an easily distinguished event (such as a historic battle or a recent rash of disappearances). If the target knows a secret about the topic (information it believes isn&rsquo;t common knowledge and which it would not normally tell you), it states it has a secret. The target doesn&rsquo;t mention anything about the secret and doesn&rsquo;t remember telling you it has a secret. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it isn&rsquo;t compelled to reveal whether it knows a secret and is aware that you asked.

<p>
You reveal the true form of a magically disguised or transformed creature, whether the target&rsquo;s transformation is physical (such as <i>polymorph</i>) or illusory (such as <i>disguise self</i>). The spell does not force the creature into its true form, but rather creates a perfect illusion of the creature&rsquo;s true form that overlaps it and hides the disguised form completely, making the true form visible to all observers. For the duration of the spell, if the target changes shape or uses illusion to disguise its appearance, observers can still see its true form, though once the spell runs out any illusions or shape changes made by the target in the meantime immediately take effect. This spell does not reveal invisible creatures, overcome effects such as <i>blur</i> and <i>displacement</i>, or penetrate mundane disguises.

<p>
This spell endows a suit of armor with a singular purpose realized only after its wearer goes unconscious or is killed; whenever the wearer of a suit of armor warded by <i>revenant armor</i> is brought below 0 hit points or otherwise rendered unconscious (but not paralyzed or held) in combat, the armor is immediately brought to life as a Medium animated object. This animated suit of armor still contains the unconscious (or dead) body of its former wearer and moves with a shambling gait at a speed of 20 feet. This animated object has average hit points and, if the armor is made from metal, it has the metal animated object extraordinary ability (plus additional abilities based on the type of metal, as indicated in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>). Once animated, the <i>revenant armor</i> remains standing (and stands if knocked prone, doing so without provoking attacks of opportunity), and prevents the wearer of the armor from being considered helpless. If an ally of the wearer is within range of the armor, she can direct it to move, though it refuses to go anywhere that requires a skill check. If grappled or otherwise restrained, it can attempt to break free with a Strength score equal to your caster level and a CMB equal to 1 + your caster level + the armor&rsquo;s Strength modifier. If the armor&rsquo;s wearer is reduced to dust, made conscious, or removed from the armor, the spell ends.

This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
</p>

<p>
Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself when the spell strikes.

Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling.

You imbue a projectile weapon with the ability to ricochet any projectiles that hit one target so that they also hit another. When the wielder ricochets a projectile, she selects a primary target to attack. If she hits the primary target, the projectile ricochets instead of being destroyed. The wielder can then select a secondary target that is within 20 feet of the primary target. She makes an attack roll against the secondary target at the same base attack bonus, but does not gain the benefit from any enhancement bonuses or magic qualities on the projectile. If the shot comes from a firearm, the ricochet targets normal AC rather than touch AC.
</p>

<p>
While the spell lasts, the target weapon&rsquo;s wielder can ricochet one projectile per three caster levels you possess, to a maximum of six at caster level 18th. Once the target weapon&rsquo;s wielder ricochets that many shots, the spell is discharged. If the weapon&rsquo;s wielder fails to use all the ricochets before the spell end, those ricochets are wasted.

You may transform into lightning as a standard action and instantly travel in a straight line to a distance of up to 120 feet, rematerializing in the new location as a free action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures in this line take 10d6 points of electrical damage and are staggered for 1 round (a successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered condition, spell resistance applies).
</p>

<p>
Objects in your path are damaged as well, with combustible objects being set ablaze and metals with low melting points melted. If your path is interrupted by a barrier or otherwise deflected, you materialize short of your final destination in the nearest open space; targets in the line to that point take damage as normal. You are immune to electricity while this spell lasts.

You stealthily project your soul into the host&rsquo;s body as an observer, with limited ability to influence the target. This functions as <i><a href="#Possession">possession</a></i>, except the host is still in full control of its body and is unaware you are possessing it. You can&rsquo;t communicate with the host directly, but you can cast mind-affecting spells or <i>riding possession</i> on the host as long as you can cast these spells as purely mental actions. Even if the spell you cast would normally affect more than one target or an area, it can affect only the host. If the host succeeds at a saving throw against a spell that you cast in this way, it immediately becomes aware that it is possessed, and if it was already aware, it receives another saving throw against <i>riding possession</i>. <i>Protection from evil</i> and similar effects don&rsquo;t expel you from the host, but they do prevent you from casting further spells from within your host until their durations expire.

<p>
This spell tears a rift in reality, creating an extradimensional hole with a depth of 60 feet. You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface&mdash;you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.
</p>

<p>
The walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid, strange chewing vermin, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift&rsquo;s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift&rsquo;s walls have a Climb DC of 25.
</p>

<p>
When this spell&rsquo;s duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift&rsquo;s environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.
</p>

<p>
At any time during the spell&rsquo;s duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell&rsquo;s duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area; these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via <i><a href="#Summon Monster VII">summon monster VII</a></i> and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the <i>rift of ruin</i> spell. You can choose to summon one of the following: one bebilith, one vrock, 1d3 shadow demons, 1d3 succubi, 1d4+1 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraks.

The target creature&rsquo;s innate goodness infuses its body with holy energy. While this energy does not directly empower the target, it can harm embodiments of evil. Any creature that damages the target with a slashing or piercing melee weapon is sprayed by the target&rsquo;s holy blood. If the attacker is a creature with the evil subtype, it takes 1d6 points of damage from divine power each time it successfully hits the target. If the target has the good subtype or an ability that grants it an aura of good (like paladins or some clerics), its blood instead deals 2d6 points of damage. Creatures that don&rsquo;t have the evil subtype or that are using reach weapons are not subject to this damage.

Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a &minus;2 penalty to your Dexterity. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. You gain DR 5/ evil (if you normally channel positive energy) or DR 5/good (if you normally channel negative energy). At 15th level, this DR becomes 10/evil or 10/good (the maximum). Your size modifier for AC and attacks changes as appropriate to your new size category. This spell doesn&rsquo;t change your speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate to your new size.
</p>

<p>
If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process (see Chapter 7 for rules on breaking objects). If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you&mdash;the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.

<p>
Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.

<p>
You conjure a cylinder of calm water on an area of solid ground or on top of a body of water. The water forms quickly but displaces only air; it doesn&rsquo;t push away objects or creatures, though anything in the area when the spell is cast is submerged. Unconscious air-breathing creatures caught in the area immediately begin to drown, but other air-breathing creatures can hold their breath while in the cylinder. Movement through the cylinder at normal speed requires a successful DC 10 Swim check (otherwise, creatures move at one-quarter speed). If conjured in an area with insufficient room for the entire cylinder, the cylinder attains its maximum possible size. It retains its shape in defiance of gravity for the spell&rsquo;s duration, and any creature can enter or exit the cylinder&rsquo;s sides as easily as stepping into or out of a pool of ordinary water. The water disappears at the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, so creatures swimming in the water immediately fall to the ground.

This spell transforms your targets into trees as per <i><a href="#Tree Shape">tree shape</a></i>, except the targets transform into living trees that resemble their original forms. If a target is in a situation that would prove fatal to a tree created by this spell, such as off the ground or under water, the target receives a +4 bonus on its Fortitude save.
</p>

<p>
If the spell succeeds, the target must also attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the creature loses the ability to observe what transpires around it, and its mental capacity reverts to that of a tree, rendering it unable to take any kind of action. A target that succeeds at the saving throw can observe the area around it but can&rsquo;t take any actions other than communicate to those under the effects of a <i>speak with plants</i> spell or to other trees. Over the span of 1 year, the target&rsquo;s appearance becomes more like a common tree and less like its original form.
</p>

<p>
Any polymorph effects on a target are automatically dispelled when the target fails to resist the effects of <i>rival&rsquo;s weald</i>, and as long as <i>rival&rsquo;s weald</i> remains in effect, the target cannot use other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form.

Summoning up the power of the tempest, you direct a current of forceful winds where you please. This spell creates a 5-foot-diameter line of wind&mdash;the direction of the wind is away from your location when you cast the spell, and remains constant in that direction for the spell duration. Creatures caught in a <i>river of wind</i> take 4d6 nonlethal damage and are knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone.
</p>

A creature that begins its turn wholly or partially within a <i>river of wind</i> must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 20 feet in the wind&rsquo;s direction of flow, take 2d6 nonlethal damage, and be knocked prone&mdash;a successful Fortitude save means the creature merely takes 1d6 nonlethal damage.

A creature with the fire subtype takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If the target is on fire, it gains a +2 bonus on its next saving throw to extinguish the flames.

You can view events transpiring along a natural watercourse you touch. You can see anything on or within the river as if you were present at that location, or you can observe anything happening within 15 feet of the river&rsquo;s banks as if peering from the water&rsquo;s surface. Moving your point of view to a different location along the river is a standard action, though your perception can follow something moving along the river as a free action.

The range of this spell is affected by whether you are attempting to gaze up or downriver&mdash;if viewing a location downriver, you can view any spot within 2 miles per caster level; if viewing upriver, you can view any spot within &frac12; mile per caster level. The magical sensor created by this spell can travel only as far along the river as your range and the river permits; obstructions such as dams and reservoirs halt the sensor, as does an estuary flowing into the sea or other body of saltwater.

A 15-foot-long lash of crumbling crystal and earth emerges from the palm of your hand. This weapon is treated as a nonmagical whip that deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage. You can wield this weapon as a whip as if you were proficient with it, and it isn&rsquo;t subject to the disarm or sunder combat maneuver. The whip passes through natural unworked stone effortlessly, allowing you to ignore cover between you and your target from such sources. Armor and natural armor have no effect on the damage dealt by a rock whip (unlike a normal whip), but the whip deals no damage to outsiders with the earth subtype. Attacks with a rock whip strike with resounding force; you can make a free bull rush combat maneuver against any creature you strike with a rock whip, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your primary casting ability score modifier (Charisma for sorcerers, Intelligence for wizards, and so on) in place of your Strength modifier.

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end.
</p>

<p>
The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the usual multiverse of extradimensional spaces.
</p>

<p>
Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). The rope cannot be removed or hidden. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.
</p>

<p>
Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can&rsquo;t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The <i>rope trick</i> spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

You cause the target rope to grow in length and weave itself into one of several forms, each of which can support up to 1,000 pounds, plus 200 pounds per caster level (maximum 3,000 pounds at 10th level). Only one type of construction can be created with each casting of the spell, and the creation remains stationary unless destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Each 5-foot section of the object created by this spell has a break DC of 23, AC 11, and 1 hit point per caster level (maximum 10 hp), but all sections of the creation are magically supported and need not be anchored to a solid surface or any other portion of the effect. Destroying one part of it does not cause the remainder of the structure to collapse, though each 5-foot section destroyed reduces the maximum weight the creation can support by 200 pounds. During any round in which the rope is overloaded, every remaining section takes 1d4 points of damage.
</p>

<p>
You can use <i>ropeweave</i> to create any of the following structures.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Rope Bridge:
	<td>	The rope forms a 5-foot-wide bridge that spans up to 10 feet horizontally per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Creatures can cross the bridge at half speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check or at full speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. The DC assumes a creature is using both hands to assist in navigating the rope bridge; the DC increases by 5 if a creature uses only one hand to steady itself and by 10 if the creature does not use its hands. A failed Acrobatics check results in failure to progress across the rope bridge; creatures that fail by 5 or more fall.
<tr>
	<th>	Rope Hammock:
	<td>	The rope knits itself into a stationary hammock suspended in midair. The hammock can be suspended at a height of 5 feet plus 5 feet per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 30 feet), with a rope ladder; see below leading up to a platform of 1 5-foot square per caster level, and at least one such square must be adjacent to the square containing the vertical rope ladder. As a move action, the caster can command the rope ladder to withdraw into the hammock. When the ladder is withdrawn, the rope hammock blends in with its surroundings and muffles sounds and smells from creatures resting on it that are taking no violent actions; noticing the rope hammock requires a successful DC 20 Perception check or Survival check, even for creatures with scent. This does not apply if the creatures in the hammock attack or move more than half speed. The hammock provides a +2 cover bonus to AC against attacks from beneath it.
<tr>
	<th>	Rope Ladder:
	<td>	The rope knots itself and hangs suspended in midair, perpendicular to the ground, stretching up to 10 feet vertically per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Climbing the rope ladder requires a successful DC 5 Climb check, or DC 0 if there is a wall adjacent to it you can brace it against.
<tr>
	<th>	Trip Line:
	<td>	The rope stretches into a tangled mass that fills one 5-foot square per caster level you have (maximum 10 squares), all of which must be contiguous (including diagonally). Any creature entering a square with this trip line must succeed at an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 if moving at half speed, DC = 15 if moving at full speed, and DC = 20 if running or charging). On a failed check, the creature&rsquo;s movement stops when it enters the square; a creature that fails by 5 or more falls prone. A creature larger than Medium gains a +2 bonus on its Acrobatics check for every size category larger than Medium it is.

You curse two or more creatures to sicken and waste away while in each others&rsquo; company. Each target that fails a Fortitude save becomes cursed with a wasting sickness. The disease has no onset period, and those who contracted it must attempt a second Fortitude save immediately. A target that fails this second saving throw takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. Every day thereafter, each target that was within 100 feet of another target during the previous 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage (reroll to determine the specific amount of damage each day). A successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that day only.
</p>

<p>
A target cannot be healed of damage from this disease (naturally or by magic) while the target is within 100 feet of another target. If healed of such damage while away from other targets, a target might take damage again the day they reconvene. This disease is a curse, and can never be cured by successful saving throws. The spell can be ended on a single target only with a successful casting of <i>remove curse</i> followed by a successful casting of <i>remove disease</i> while the target is within 100 feet of at least one other target. When the curse remains on only one target, it ends automatically.

You create a minor earthquake that can trip creatures. Attempt a single combat maneuver check and apply the result against the CMD of every creature in the area. If your roll equals or exceeds a creature&rsquo;s CMD, that creature is knocked prone. This trip attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though you do provoke one for casting the spell), nor are you knocked prone if you fail the check by 10 or more. Unlike with a regular trip attack, you can trip any creature touching the ground, regardless of size. Improved Trip does not affect this spell in any way. Though the earthquake is small and focused on the ground, if the area is particularly unstable, the spell might cause items to topple, stones to shake loose from the walls or ceiling, and so on at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.

<p>
You utter a brief anecdote or bit of news as the verbal component of this spell and track its progress through a social gathering or other crowd. When someone who heard the rumor directly from you and repeated the rumor is within your range, they glow silver to your sight, though this glow doesn&rsquo;t occur if the creature is in disguise (unless it was in the same disguise at the time of casting). You can choose to follow the rumor by selecting any such creature in range, at which point the creatures who heard the rumor from you no longer glow silver, and now the creatures who heard the rumor from your chosen creature glow silver instead. You can follow the rumor&rsquo;s path until you reach a creature that heard the rumor but didn&rsquo;t repeat it (or repeated it incorrectly). The glow identifies only creatures who heard the same information you conveyed. Minor cosmetic changes in the rumor don&rsquo;t interrupt the chain, but when the rumor no longer resembles the information you imparted, the trail stops and the spell ends.
</p>

<p>
You can instead use this spell to trace a rumor back to its source once you hear it. In this case, you repeat the rumor as you heard it for the spell&rsquo;s verbal component. The person who told you the rumor can attempt a Will save to end the effect. Failure indicates the silver glow leads to the individual that told her. This process continues each time you locate the next individual spreading the same information. Each individual attempts the save until one of them succeeds (in which case the spell ends and you can&rsquo;t attempt to trace this particular rumor again) or you trace the rumor to its original source. As with the other application of the spell, tracing a rumor back fails to cause a creature to glow if it is in disguise, unless it was in the same disguise at the time of speaking the rumor.

<p>
You scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface, similar to the way in which a <i>symbol</i> spell is cast. When inscribed, the <i>rune of Jandelay</i> manifests as a shape that evokes the face of a monstrous elephantine creature&mdash;the legendary Oliphant of Jandelay itself. The rune is 5 feet across when created, and the surface on which it is to be inscribed must be large enough to bear it.
</p>

<p>
The <i>rune of Jandelay</i> is a potent ward against the primal chaos of the Great Beyond. While it is primarily intended to combat the forces of the Maelstrom, it is equally useful against forces from the other chaotic Outer Planes. When cast, the rune stabilizes and reinforces an area in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on it. <i>Earthquake</i>, <i>transmute rock to mud</i>, <i>stone shape</i>, <i>spike stones</i>, and other spell effects that magically damage or manipulate terrain or structures deal no damage and do not alter anything in the area. Damaging spells that specifically target these structures or regions do not deal damage, but area-affecting spells may damage creatures in the area as normal. Strong chaos planar alignment is reduced to mild alignment, and mild chaos planar alignment is negated entirely in this area.
</p>

<p>
Creatures with the chaotic subtype in the area of a <i>rune of Jandelay</i> must save against the spell or gain 2 negative levels for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that saves and leaves the area must save again upon reentering the area. These negative levels can never result in permanent level loss but cannot be restored by <i>restoration</i> or similar magic.

You curse a magic item, such as magical clothing, a suit of armor, or a weapon. The object is reduced to 1/4 its normal hit point total, gains the broken condition, and appears damaged and worn. If it grants a numeric bonus, such as a +2 deflection bonus to AC, that bonus is reduced by 1 for every 3 caster levels you possess, to a minimum of +0. Other magical qualities fail to work 50% of the time when called upon, so a resistance bonus on saves or a weapon&rsquo;s <i>flaming</i> special ability could fail each time the item is used.
</p>

<p>
If the object is an intelligent magical item, its Ego score remains unchanged despite its reduced quality. The weapon has only a 50% chance to successfully use any spells or spell-like abilities it has, and has a 25% chance of forgetting its special purpose (if any). If an intelligent weapon is actively dominating its wielder when it fails its save against <i>rune of ruin</i>, the wielder gains an immediate saving throw with a +4 bonus to regain control. <i>Rune of ruin</i> has no affect on magical artifacts.

Investigations into the ancient and mysterious traditions of the seven virtues of rule of the lost human empire of Azlant, which were later corrupted by the runelords into the more familiar seven deadly sins, inspired the Cyphermages to develop the runes of rule. This spell allows you to place a rune upon another creature that can then be used to aid it at a later time. You determine the spell&rsquo;s effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient&rsquo;s body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp. The inscribed rune lasts for 24 hours or until the spell is activated. Unless otherwise noted, the creature upon which the <i>rune of rule</i> has been inscribed can activate it at any time as a swift action. If the spell effect isn&rsquo;t used, all markings associated with the rune disappear and the effect fades. You can never place the spell upon yourself&mdash;it must be bestowed on someone else. The seven runes of rule, along with their specific effects when the user activates them, are listed below. A creature can bear only one <i>rune of rule</i> at a time.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Charity:
	<td>	A creature bearing this mark gains a +5 insight bonus on a single attack roll or skill check attempted at the request of another creature, provided the creature bearing this mark does not gain any immediate benefit or reward for making the roll or attempting the check.
<tr>
	<th>	Generosity:
	<td>	A creature bearing the rune of generosity can activate it as an immediate action, but it must do so as another creature within 30 feet activates a consumable magic item such as a potion or scroll that was given to it at some point within the last 24 hours by the creature bearing the rune. When the rune is activated, the effects of the consumable magic item resolve at a caster level that is 2 higher than the item&rsquo;s actual caster level.
<tr>
	<th>	Humility:
	<td>	When a creature activates the rune of humility, it does not provoke attacks of opportunity for 1 round.
<tr>
	<th>	Kindness:
	<td>	A creature must be using the aid another action or casting a healing spell in order to activate a rune of kindness. If the creature activates the rune while using the aid another action, the bonus imparted on a success increases to +5. If the creature instead activates the rune while casting a healing spell, the effective caster level of the spell increases by 2.
<tr>
	<th>	Love:
	<td>	When a creature activates the rune of love as he casts a spell with the charm descriptor, the save DC of that spell increases by 1. Alternatively, a creature can activate the rune of love after he rolls damage for a weapon or spell attack, causing the damage dealt to become nonlethal damage.
<tr>
	<th>	Temperance:
	<td>	A creature bearing the rune of temperance can activate it as an immediate action immediately upon failing a saving throw against a poison, disease, drug, or similar effect. The creature can immediately attempt a second saving throw against the effect and can use the result of that second saving throw as the actual result.
<tr>
	<th>	Zeal:
	<td>	A creature that activates the rune of zeal gains a +3 bonus on Will saves, and the save DCs of all language-dependent effects created by the creature increase by 1; these effects last for 1 round.

By immersing yourself fully in the intricacies of a carved or written rune of any kind, you can divine the elements of that rune&rsquo;s nature. While casting <i>rune trace</i>, you must run your fingers (which cannot be gloved at the time) over the rune, glyph, symbol, or other marking you want to examine (hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;rune&rdquo;). This does not trigger any effects that touching the rune would normally trigger. Runes, symbols, and other effects that trigger when read still trigger as normal if you do so&mdash;but note that this spell does not require you to view and read the rune that you&rsquo;re targeting. When the spell&rsquo;s casting time ends, you instantly receive flashes of insight regarding the rune&rsquo;s nature, history, and purpose, including the following information.
</p>

<table class=Options>

This spell charges magical runes to an explosive degree. If cast on a creature with magical runes on its body, such as a rune giant or a runescarred creature, it deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the target and stuns the target for 1 round. When the spell is cast in this way, it must overcome the target&rsquo;s spell resistance. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the stun effect.
</p>

<p>
The spell can also be cast on other magical runes, such as those from <i>arcane mark</i> or <i>explosive runes</i>. In this case, the resulting explosion deals 1d8 points of sonic damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8) to all creatures within a 5-foot radius. Creatures in the area that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage. This spell doesn&rsquo;t destroy runes; targeted runes continue to function normally. Mundane runes, such as ones in writing or runic tattoos, cannot be affected by this spell.

Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-footradius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell.
</p>

<p>
You may employ <i>rusting grasp</i> in combat with a successful melee touch attack. <i>Rusting grasp</i> used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of AC gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offers) through corrosion.
</p>

<p>
Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Striking at an opponent&rsquo;s weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around.
</p>

<p>
Against a ferrous creature, <i>rusting grasp</i> instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.

You trap the target in an object decorated with the holy symbols of your god or faith. While trapped in the object, the creature can&rsquo;t take any actions and is immune to spells and spell-like abilities. The creature remains permanently trapped in the object as long the object remains in your possession. Only a <i>freedom</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell can dispel the enchantment, though destroying the object frees the creature.
</p>

<p>
If you relinquish your stewardship of the object (such as giving it away or leaving it in a remote location or extradimensional space), the trapped creature begins to gain control over the object. It immediately gains the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature now in possession of the object. It still can&rsquo;t take any actions besides communicating but can use feats and skills related to speaking (such as Bluff and Diplomacy).
</p>

<p>
After 1 week of the object being out of your presence, the creature can create a number of haunts with a total CR (that is, the CR of the encounter with all of the haunts at once) equaling 1/4 the creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice. These haunts are centered on the object. The creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point.
</p>

<p>
After 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to &frac12; its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object.
</p>

<p>
After 1 year of being out of your presence, in addition to the above abilities, the creature can attempt to possess any living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that touches the object, as per <i><a href="#Possession">possession</a></i>. However, the creature can&rsquo;t personally destroy the object, even while possessing another creature.
</p>

<p>
Because the binding magic irrevocably weakens the longer you&rsquo;re away from the item, returning it to your ownership doesn&rsquo;t reverse any of the effects. You must free the creature and impose another <i>sacramental seal</i> if you want to restrict its abilities again.
</p>

<p>
If the object is placed in the stewardship of creatures or a location belonging to your faith, it still counts as being out of your presence but it takes ten times longer for the creature to manifest the above abilities (it would take 10 weeks for it to manifest the ability to create haunts, for example).

	<td>	Making a sacrifice the round before creating a <i>magic circle</i> and preparing a summoning diagram amplifies the power of its warding magic, increasing the DC of Charisma checks the creature might attempt to escape. This lasts 1 day.
</table>

<p>
Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in conjuring and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect for a particular conjuration.
</p>

<p>
A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target&mdash;few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.
</p>

<p>
The table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering&rsquo;s equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of <i>planar ally</i>. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature&rsquo;s choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.
</p>

<p>
You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain 2 permanent negative levels to gain a +16 bonus, nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 Hit Dice worth of creatures to pay for a 10-HD creature&rsquo;s service.

You create a powerful bond between yourself and a single creature. Until the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, each time the target is hit with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can take the full damage of that attack and any other effects that creature suffers. If you choose not to take on the damage and effects, you instead take a number of points of damage equal to your Constitution score as backlash. Any resistances or immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or effects of either the transfer or the backlash. If you or the subject of the spell move out of line of sight, the spell ends.

You and your mount form a perfect synergy that endows both of you with advantages based upon how far you travel each round. For every 5 feet your mount moves in a given round, you gain a +1 competence bonus on Ride checks and both you and your mount gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls made with weapons or natural attacks for 1 round. For instance, if your mount traveled 40 feet in a round, you would gain a +8 bonus on Ride checks and you and your mount would both gain a +8 bonus on damage rolls for 1 round, to a maximum bonus equal to your caster level. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your mount, the spell immediately ends.

<i>Sand table</i> allows you to create a scale model of the battlefield surrounding your position, showing numbers of troops, their relative positions, and their movement as if you were observing from a great height overhead (1,000 feet up). You cast the spell upon a table or other flat surface and cause the model to appear upon a 5-foot-by-5-foot section of that table or surface. It reflects accurate terrain and topography, though it doesn&rsquo;t identify fine topographical features or concealed or hidden topography. It also indicates all normally visible Small or larger creatures within the area of effect, but it doesn&rsquo;t provide identifying characteristics of those creatures; each creature appears as an indistinct speck, under 1 millimeter in each dimension.
</p>

<p>
The spell marks obvious war camps and contingents of troops with a symbol of their banner (if they openly carry such a symbol). The spell provides a snapshot of the topography and creature locations when cast; it doesn&rsquo;t adjust for changes that occur during the duration. The table shows the land surrounding itself up to a 1-mile radius from the surface. The <i>sand table</i> does not reveal invisible or incorporeal creatures, nor does it include creatures that are underground, indoors, submerged below the surface of water, below a tree line or other source of cover from above, or flying above 1,000 feet in the air. Those looking at the table can spot Small and larger creatures that are using Stealth to hide, but they take a &minus;10 penalty on their Perception checks because of the size of the models.
</p>

<p>
Once the spell has been cast, if anything moves or shakes the surface upon which it was placed, the spell ends instantly.

While casting this spell, you slowly destroy a piece of art bearing your victim&rsquo;s likeness and beseech Achaekek to grant you access to the knowledge and lore contained within the innermost sanctum of the Crimson Citadel, the Sarzari Library. This endows you with information that could facilitate the target&rsquo;s assassination by your hands. This information must be chosen from one of the three following categories&mdash;back doors, character, or weakness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Back doors&rdquo; informs you of hidden passages and other means of navigation within your target&rsquo;s home. While inside your target&rsquo;s home, you gain a +10 insight bonus on Perception checks and gain the constant benefits of <i>detect secret doors</i> and <i>find traps</i>. You automatically see through any illusory walls in the target&rsquo;s home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Character&rdquo; lets you know of a compromising detail about your target&rsquo;s personal life, giving you a +10 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks when attempting to gather information about your contracted victim from other people. Your target takes a &minus;2 penalty on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects you generate, and you gain a +4 bonus on caster level checks you attempt to overcome the target&rsquo;s spell resistance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Weakness&rdquo; grants you knowledge of physical vulnerabilities your target has, as well as information about the target&rsquo;s damage reduction, immunities, and other defensive abilities. If these vulnerabilities and defenses change during the spell&rsquo;s duration, you immediately know. You automatically confirm all critical threats against the target. 
</p>

<p>
Once your victim is slain or a month has passed (whichever comes first), the information you gained from the spell fades. While you can recall certain elements of these memories, you no longer gain any of the benefits associated with the spell. You can only have one target affected by <i>Sarzari shadow memory</i> at any one time; if you cast this spell a second time while a previous casting is still active, the effects of the new spell replace the effects of the old one.

Your teeth extend and sharpen, transforming your mouth into a maw of razor-sharp fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier.

You are considered proficient with this attack. If used as part of a full-attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus &minus;5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage.

This spell targets an area of earth, metal, stone, or wood, causing long, serrated blades to shoot out from random points within the area of effect. Any creature in the area when the spell is first cast must attempt a Reflex save to avoid taking 3d8 points of piercing damage from the blades and an additional 2d6 points of bleed damage. A creature that fails the save also has its speed reduced by half for 24 hours or until the injured creature benefits from a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; spell (which restores lost hit points as normal). Another creature can remove the penalty by succeeding on a Heal check against the spell&rsquo;s save DC as a standard action. The lashing limbs remain active in the area for the remainder of the spell&rsquo;s duration, during which time the area is treated as difficult terrain, and any creature that moves into or through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage. The transformed area can be located on any visible surface within range, including floors, walls, doors, ceilings, or other generally flat surfaces.

Your touch causes a single creature&rsquo;s skin to produce fibrous tissue that sutures the creature&rsquo;s wounds, rapidly closing them and leaving jagged scars where the wounds were. The process is painful, and converts 2d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5) into nonlethal damage. If the target creature is immune to nonlethal damage, the spell fails. Damage resistance against nonlethal damage reduces the amount of damage converted. This effect counts as healing for the purpose of stopping bleed damage. Kuthites are especially fond of this spell, as it gives them permanent physical reminders of the all too brief pain they endured.

You, or a willing creature you touch, lay down a trail of scents that only the creatures you designate at the time of can detect. These creatures find it very easy to follow this trail. They gain a +20 competence bonus on any Survival checks made for the purpose of tracking the creature laying this trail. Subject creatures with the scent special ability gain a +10 competence bonus on Wisdom or Survival checks to follow the trail.
</p>

<p>
In addition, you can leave scent messages along the trail. Each word or emotion in this message requires spending a move action in the same spot. Subject creatures seeking to understand this message must make another DC 20 Survival check, with a &minus;1 penalty for every word or emotion in the message, in order to understand it. Creatures cannot benefit from this smell if they cannot use, or do not have, a sense of smell. Creatures can use this spell to backtrack through a dungeon, maze, or similar areas even if the creature laying down the trail crossed over the spot multiple times.

You create a vibrant wall of hypnotic light and color. The wall does not impede movement or line of sight in any way. Creatures moving through the wall must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated. Each round, on its turn, a fascinated creature can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature that succeeds at the save against the fascination effect is no longer affected if it remains within the wall, but it must attempt a new saving throw if it leaves the area and later moves through the wall again. Creatures adjacent to the wall and creatures moving through the wall that succeed at their save against fascination are dazzled.
</p>

<p>
If you create the wall so that it appears in the same space as one or more creatures, each affected creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or become blinded. Creatures that successfully save against the blindness are subject to the fascination effect unless they leave the wall within 1 round of casting the spell.
</p>

<i>Scintillating wall</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell cast by a caster of 13th level or higher, at a cost of 12,500 gp.

This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell&rsquo;s area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

Hermea&rsquo;s benevolent Council of Enlightenment uses this spell to humanely preserve their society&rsquo;s greatest minds from the ravages of time, though it has seen far more sinister employment when put to use by other organizations that have since discovered its utility. This spell binds a single creature into a prepared book, sustaining it in suspended animation and filling the book with its experience and knowledge. The tome weighs 10 pounds and has one page for every day of the subject&rsquo;s life. The cover and binding transform to reflect the subject&rsquo;s appearance, interests, and tastes. Every thought and memory&mdash;including those the target may have forgotten long ago&mdash;are perfectly transcribed within the enchanted pages, penned in excruciating detail in the language that the creature was thinking or speaking in when the event occurred. If a memory includes dialogue in a language the subject didn&rsquo;t understand, that dialogue is reproduced phonetically, and must be translated by a reader who knows that language. Any alterations to a subject&rsquo;s memories&mdash;such as by a <i>modify memory</i> spell&mdash;appear in a subtly different script; a successful DC 35 Linguistics check is needed to identify this.
</p>

<p>
Spells that modify or remove text&mdash;such as <i>erase</i> or <i>secret page</i>&mdash;also affect the target&rsquo;s memory if they persist after its release. <i>Modify memory</i> can be used to repair any changes to its original state, or alter the accounts recorded within the book. A creature imprisoned by scribe&rsquo;s binding automatically fails any saving throws against effects to change or modify its memories.
</p>

<p>
A target bound by this spell can be freed by only <i>freedom</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. <i>Polymorph any object</i> restores the target&rsquo;s normal form for 24 hours. Scribe&rsquo;s binding makes the imprisoning tome supernaturally durable (hardness 20, 10 hp per HD the imprisoned creature had). Destroying the tome immediately slays the creature imprisoned within.

This spell imbues a quill with animate energy and rapidly transcribes words from one page to another. The quill copies a written work at the rate of one normal-sized page per minute. The Linguistics skill can be used to make a convincing copy, but otherwise the reproduction is written in the hand of the caster. You must concentrate upon the material being duplicated for the spell&rsquo;s duration and provide new blank pages as required. The <i>scrivener&rsquo;s chant</i> requires blank paper and a quill or other writing materials, in addition to the material components.

If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.

<p>
As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: <i>detect chaos</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect law</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, and <i>message.</i>
</p>

<p>
If the save succeeds, you can&rsquo;t attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours.

With a clammy caress and a word to the powers lurking beyond death, you can reshape a dead body look like another creature or even a specific person so long as you have firsthand knowledge of how that creature or person actually looks.
</p>

<p>
You can make the corpse one size larger or smaller and change anything else about it including its apparent type, gender, or age. Creatures with a reason to suspect deception may make a Will saving throw to realize that the corpse was altered. If you chose to make the corpse look like a specific individual anyone who knows that individual can make a Will save to realize that the corpse is not actually that person. However, if a creature fails its Will save by 5 or less they believe the corpse is that of someone who closely resembled the person they knew rather than a deliberate fake. This spell merely changes the appearance of the corpse. Any spell or effect that targets the corpse (such as <i>speak with dead</i> or <i>raise dead</i>) treats it as if it still had its original appearance.

You cause all areas of water to which you have line of effect to recede as if you had cast <i><a href="#Control Water">control water</a></i>. Exposed water that enters the area ebbs away, evaporating or leaching into the ground at a rate of 1 foot of depth per hour. Living creatures in the area when the spell is cast are parched with thirst and take a &minus;4 penalty on Constitution checks to resist the effects of a hot climate, and their daily water requirement to avoid thirst doubles. Plant creatures and inanimate plants take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per hour after the first 24 hours, which bypasses hardness and damage reduction. Living creatures with the aquatic or water subtype, unless completely immersed in water, must attempt a DC 20 Constitution check each hour no matter how much water they drink. A creature that fails takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and becomes fatigued until it recovers from the nonlethal damage.
</p>

<p>
After 1 week, the soil in the area of <i>sea of dust</i> begins to break down and blow away. Moderate winds have a 50% chance each hour to cause sandstorms. This chance increases to 75% in strong winds and 100% in severe or stronger winds. Short-duration wind effects such as <i>gust of wind</i> create sandstorms with the same area and duration as the spell, plus an identical duration after the spell ends.
</p>

<p>
After 1 month, the soil in an area affected by <i>sea of dust</i> has virtually disintegrated. The area is treated as a shallow bog for the purposes of movement, with a 25% chance each hour to encounter an area equivalent to a deep bog 2d6&times;10 feet across, and a 5% chance to encounter a collapsing dust drift equivalent to quicksand 1d6&times;5 feet across. The affected region remains desertlike in condition until the magic is dispelled, at which point the region recovers and returns to its original terrain over the course of time (this may take only days or weeks, or it could take months or even years, subject to GM discretion). This spell has no effect if cast on an entirely aquatic region. If the spell is cast on an island, the effects of the spell extend to the shore but not beyond.

You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the <i>seamantle</i>, but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have <i>freedom of movement</i> effects. The cover granted by the <i>seamantle</i> does not enable you to make Stealth checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as <i>cloudkill</i>).
</p>

<p>
The <i>seamantle</i> blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the <i>seamantle</i>; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes as a bubble of steam contained within the <i>seamantle</i> rather than its usual effect.
</p>

<p>
The <i>seamantle</i> allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch.
</p>

<p>
You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i>; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as <i>flame blade</i>, <i>flaming sphere</i>, or <i>incendiary cloud</i>). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A <i>flaming</i> or <i>flaming burst</i> weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.

Strands of shadow probe an area, searching for a creature or object you specify by shape, size, or texture. Each round, the shadows attempt a Perception check on the squares they touch with a total bonus equal to your caster level + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher. You can move the shadows up to 30 feet or change the search criteria as part of concentrating on the spell. Whenever the shadows come into contact with a creature with spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check to overcome its spell resistance. If you fail, the spell ends.
</p>

<p>
When the shadows locate a desired item or creature, you are aware of its shape and size and can order the shadows to try to seize it. If the shadows are seeking a creature, the area they cover becomes difficult terrain for that creature, and the creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become entangled and unable to move. Changing the criteria of the creature or object sought or moving the shadows away from an entangled target frees it. If the target is an object carried by a creature, the shadows attempt a disarm or steal combat maneuver check as appropriate, using the same modifier as for their Perception check. The shadows can pick up and move unattended, nonmagical objects that weigh up to 5 pounds.

By touching a living target, you cause a half-formed, parasitic clone of the target to burst from its midsection. The twin dangles from the target&rsquo;s body, making it difficult for the target to move easily and imparting a &minus;2 penalty on Acrobatics and Climb checks. In addition, for the spell&rsquo;s duration, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn each round, or else it takes 1 point of Constitution damage and is sickened for that round as the twin siphons off its blood. Each time the target receives any healing (magical or otherwise), the duration of this spell is extended by 1 round. Each attack that deals damage to the target reduces the duration of this spell by 1 round. If the duration reaches 0 rounds in this manner, the twin is violently excised from the body, and the target takes 1d6 points of bleed damage (which can be healed as normal).
</p>

The effect of <i>sebaceous twin</i> counts as a disease effect with a DC equal to the spell&rsquo;s saving throw DC.

<p>
You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as 60 days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest&rsquo;s actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.
</p>

<p>
The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
</p>

<p>
To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, even with a <i>wish</i> spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.
</p>

<p>
Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.

<i>Secret page</i> alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster.
</p>

This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. <i>Explosive runes</i> or <i>sepia snake sigil</i> can be cast upon the <i>secret page</i>.
</p>

A <i>comprehend languages</i> spell alone cannot reveal a <i>secret page</i>&rsquo;s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word.

<p>
You invisibly inscribe a small mark or short message (no more than 25 words) on a creature or object, similar to the way <i><a href="#Arcane Mark">arcane mark</a></i> works. The sign can be no more than 6 inches across, and if it&rsquo;s a written message, it can be in any language you can read and write at the time of the spell&rsquo;s casting. As you cast the spell, you can define one auditory, olfactory, tangible, or visual criterion&mdash;such as all creatures wearing green bands on their left arms or only creatures who smell of lavender or only orcs&mdash;that allows designated creatures within 30 feet to see the <i>secret sign</i>.
</p>

<p>
Disguises and illusions that mimic the set criterion can fool this spell. Normal darkness doesn&rsquo;t conceal a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Auditory criteria (such as a password) and tangible criteria (such as pressing your hand against a specific object or wall) can be performed by anyone who learns of them. A <i>secret sign</i> cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb, but can differentiate apparent races, genders, and garments. <i>See invisibility</i> and <i>invisibility purge</i> reveal the sign, but <i>glitterdust</i> does not.
</p>

<p>
A caster of at least 10th level can make <i>secret sign</i> permanent on an object with a <i>permanency</i> spell using 5,000 gp of diamond dust as a material component.

This spell grants the target the ability to send secret messages embedded within normal speech. This is similar to the secret messages ability of the Bluff skill, but no check is needed; the speaker&rsquo;s intended recipient always understands the hidden message perfectly, but other listeners cannot perceive the message at all. The target can send only one message at a time, though it can send that message to multiple listeners. The secret message is considered to be in the same language the target is speaking, and intended recipients hear and understand both the actual speech and the secret message. The target can make itself understood as far as its voice carries.
</p>

<p>
For example, at a fancy noble&rsquo;s wedding, a jealous former suitor casts this spell on himself before making a speech. Everyone hears his glowing words of praise, but only his allies hear his secret message instructing them to attack the groom.

You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. The lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
</p>

<p>
The shelter must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise&mdash;it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).
</p>

<p>
The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being secured with <i>arcane lock</i> and the latter by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an <i>alarm</i> spell. Finally, an <i>unseen servant</i> is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.
</p>

<p>
The <i>secure shelter</i> contains crude furnishings&mdash;eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.

Similar to <i><a href="#Detect Thoughts">detect thoughts</a></i>, <i>seek thoughts</i> allows you to sift through the surface thoughts of those around you. You may scan for either the answer to a simple question (such as &ldquo;Where is the hidden lair of the wererats?&rdquo;) or for information on a general topic (such as the beliefs of an evil cult). You detect the number of creatures who are thinking about this question or topic within range, as well as their location if they are visible to you. <i>Seek thoughts</i> does not let you read actual surface thoughts, only if a given creature is thinking about the topic you are concentrating on. A successful Will save prevents you from sensing a creature&rsquo;s thoughts for the duration of the spell.

If the caster of the divination fails, deadly magical feedback strikes at him, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level).
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, if you cast <i>bestow curse</i>, <i>chaos hammer</i>, <i>contagion</i>, <i>holy smite</i>, <i>order&rsquo;s wrath</i>, <i>poison</i>, or <i>unholy blight</i> in the round immediately following <i>seer&rsquo;s bane</i>, you can replace the spell&rsquo;s damaging effect with the effects of that second spell (the divination&rsquo;s caster&mdash;and potentially those around him&mdash;save as normal for the modifying spell).

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Alarm">alarm</a></i>, except that you can tweak the spell to be more discerning in what types of creatures or objects trigger the <i>alarm</i>. Instead of being triggered whenever a creature of Tiny size or larger enters the warded area, you can set whatever triggering conditions you wish, as long as they are based on observable phenomenon. For example, you could cause the selective <i>alarm</i> to trigger when creatures of a certain race (such as orcs, bugbears, or kobolds) enter the area, or whenever a group of four or more creatures enters the area together, or when a metal object is brought into the area. You can&rsquo;t choose triggering conditions that rely on unobservable information, such as having it triggered when creatures of a certain alignment enter the area, nor could you have the <i>alarm</i> be triggered by &ldquo;something worth more than 5,000 gp&rdquo; entering the area, or even &ldquo;a weapon&rdquo; entering the area, because an item&rsquo;s value and classification as a weapon is subjective, and might vary from one person to the next.

You make the target construct appear to be a living creature of flesh and bone, regardless of its actual materials. You can make it seem 1 foot shorter or taller, and appear thin, fat, or anywhere in between. Its bodily configuration does not change; for example, a centaur-like construct looks like a centaur rather than a human. The extent of the apparent change (such as flesh color, hair color, apparent age, and so on) is up to you.
</p>

<p>
The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile or audible properties of the construct. If you use this spell to create a disguise, the construct gains a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer receives a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.

You can sense the presence of mental disturbance in creatures within range, focusing your detection on one creature each round. If the target is currently suffering from any form of madness or addiction, has total sanity damage greater than or equal to its sanity edge, or is under a magical compulsion that could be detected by <i>detect magic</i>, you can detect the presence of such a disturbance on the first round of concentration.
</p>

<p>
If you concentrate on the same creature for an additional round, you learn if the creature&rsquo;s total sanity damage is greater than or equal to its sanity edge, and you can attempt a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 10 + the save DC of the target&rsquo;s madness or addiction to determine the exact nature of a madness or addiction. Additionally, you can attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the compulsion against each magical compulsion currently affecting the target that could be detected by <i>detect magic</i>. If successful, you can identify the specific spell affecting the target. You gain a +4 bonus on your Spellcraft check if the effect is <i>confusion</i>, <i>insanity</i>, or a similar effect that explicitly causes madness or <i>insanity</i>. If you successfully identify such an effect with <i>sense madness</i>, the insights provided by this spell grant you a +1 circumstance bonus on your next caster level check in the following 1 minute made to counter, dispel, or remove that specific effect.

<p>
You restore the senses to the severed head of a humanoid or monstrous humanoid killed within the past 24 hours, creating a grisly sentinel. The head must be affixed to a pole, spear, tree branch, or other stable object, and the spell ends if the head or its object is moved. The head has darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision, can swivel in place to look in any direction, and has a +5 bonus on Perception checks.
</p>

<p>
If you are within 30 feet of the head, as a standard action you can shift your senses to it, seeing and hearing from its location and gaining the benefit of its darkvision and low-light vision, and you may use its Perception skill instead of your own. While your senses are in the severed head, your body is blind and deaf until you spend a free action to shift your senses back to your own body.
</p>

<p>
When you create the head, you can imprint it with a single triggering condition, similar to <i><a href="#Magic Mouth">magic mouth</a></i>. Once this triggering condition is set, it can never be changed. If you are within 30 feet of the head, you immediately know if it is triggered (if you have multiple active <i>sentry skulls</i>, you also know which one was triggered). This wakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb your concentration. For example, you could have a <i>sentry skull</i> alert you if any humanoid comes into view, if a particular rival approaches, if your guard animal is killed, and so on, as long as it occurs where the severed head can see it.
</p>

<p>
This spell does not give the head any ability to speak, think, or take any kind of action other than to turn itself, though it is a suitable target for other spells such as <i>magic mouth</i>.

<p>
You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written work. The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the <i>sepia snake sigil</i> springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of between the symbol and the reader.
</p>

<p>
Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake&rsquo;s strike. If it succeeds, the <i>sepia snake</i> dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of duncolored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed.
</p>

<p>
While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.
</p>

<p>
The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and <i>detect magic</i> reveals only that the entire text is magical.
</p>

<p>
A <i>dispel magic</i> can remove the sigil. An <i>erase</i> spell destroys the entire page of text.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sepia snake sigil</i> can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as secret page.

Creatures affected by <i>sequester</i> become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.

<i>Sequester thoughts</i> allows you to erase a creature&rsquo;s memory of either an event lasting not more than 1 minute per caster level or all of its knowledge about a single topic (using the GM&rsquo;s discretion as to what constitutes a single topic). For example, you could erase a single battle from a creature&rsquo;s memory, or all knowledge of a plot to assassinate a king.
</p>

<p>
The memories you remove are stored within the gem used at the time of casting. If the gem is shattered, the memories return to the creature as long as the two are within 30 feet of each other. Once <i>sequester thoughts</i> has been cast, the spell remains active on the gem and can be dispelled (which shatters it). No portion of the spell remains active on the target creature, and the target does not radiate magic as a consequence of the spell, nor can its memories be returned by dispelling the creature or subjecting it to antimagic. If the gem is shattered or dispelled out of range from the creature, the thoughts sequestered within are forever lost save by the use of <i>wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or the like.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sequester thoughts</i> protects against <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>zone of truth</i>, <i>discern lies</i>, and similar spells where the memories removed are concerned, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in the creature&rsquo;s memory, or that it has been affected by the spell. Note that the creature itself does not remember any details of what memories were removed until the gem is broken.

With a sweep of your hand, you select a number of targets and the same number of suits of armor. The targets of this spell are immediately clad in the armor that you choose. The subjects of the spell must be capable of wearing the chosen armor, cannot be wearing other armor, and must be able to properly fit into the chosen armor. The chosen armor must be empty and cannot be currently worn by another creature (thus you cannot move armor from one wearer to another with this spell). Creatures armored with this spell are considered to have donned the armor properly.

You reach into the target creature and cause that spirits within to become dormant and inactive. If the target is a medium with a spirit inhabiting its body or a spiritualist with a phantom inhabiting its consciousness (or a member of another class using the spirit or phantom class features), a failed save renders that spirit or phantom powerless, suppressing any benefits the spirit or phantom normally provides to its host, including bonus feats and spells known.

<p>
If a spirit within the target is a creature using a <i>possession</i> effect, including <i>possess object</i>, <i>possession</i>, or a ghost&rsquo;s malevolence, the spell targets the possessing creature rather than the creature it inhabits. On a failed save, the possessing spirit isn&rsquo;t exorcised from the target but is dazed for the duration of the spell.

You summon a set of Small or Medium masterwork restraints into being. When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are manacles or fetters (manacles specifically designed to fit around the ankles). You also summon the restraints&rsquo; key to your person; the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 + your caster level + the modifier of your primary casting ability score. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell&rsquo;s casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell&rsquo;s DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target&rsquo;s limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together.
</p>

<p>
As you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per <i><a href="#Dimensional Anchor">dimensional anchor</a></i> with a duration of 1 minute per caster level. If you are 18th level or higher and use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, the restraints&rsquo; hardness increases to 30, they have 60 hit points, and they can&rsquo;t be broken with a successful Strength check. (The emerald must be worth at least 2,000 gp if you also wish to use the <i>dimensional anchor</i> effect described earlier.)
</p>

<p>
If you cast this spell before the duration of a previous casting has lapsed, you can create a new set of restraints or reset the previous spell&rsquo;s duration. If you used an expensive material component during a previous casting, you must again use a component when creating new restraints or resetting the duration if you wish to maintain the special effect. You do not need to touch these previously created shackles to renew their duration, though you must be on the same plane as the shackles. When this spell ends, the restraints disappear, and any ongoing effects created by the spell end.

The target&rsquo;s shadow becomes a flexible tether to its current square. The creature can move up to 5 feet from that square without penalty. Moving farther than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to make a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMB of 10 + &frac12; your caster level + your Intelligence modifier (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a bard or sorcerer). The target takes a &minus;1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target&rsquo;s move is wasted and it cannot move farther away. If it fails this check by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet toward the tether square and is knocked prone. If it beats the check by 10 or more, the spell ends. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. If the target uses a teleportation effect or leaves the current plane, the spell ends.

This spell, developed originally by priests of Zon-Kuthon in Nidal&rsquo;s early years, has recently crossed the boundary between divine and arcane magic. Although it still bears some of the stigma of being associated with the Midnight Lord, it&rsquo;s rapidly becoming a favorite spell of magi and other martially minded arcane spellcasters.
</p>

<p>
When you cast this spell, you create a shadowy spiked chain that shimmers and pulses with darkness. The chain exists as long as you carry it; if you ever drop the chain, give it to another, or are disarmed, it immediately vanishes and the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.
</p>

<p>
The chain radiates darkness in a 10-foot-radius spread around you, reducing the illumination level in this area by one step, but not below the level of dim light.
</p>

<p>
You can wield the <i>shadow barbs</i> as a spiked chain as if you were fully proficient with spiked chains. Any additional abilities or feats that you possess that apply to spiked chains apply to the <i>shadow barbs</i> as well. The weapon functions as a <i>+2 vicious spiked chain</i>. Its enhancement bonus increases to +3 at caster level 11th, to +4 at caster level 15th, and finally to +5 at caster level 19th. When the spell effect ends, you can make a Will save against the spell&mdash;if successful, all of the damage caused to you by the <i>shadow barbs</i>&rsquo; vicious weapon quality vanishes, unless you are dead or unconscious at the time the spell ends, in which case you automatically fail this Will save and the vicious weapon damage remains.

You exchange the crude matter of your material body with the insubstantial essence of the Plane of Shadow, becoming a living shadow yourself. You are visible as an unattached shadow in bright light or normal light, but you gain total concealment in dim light or darkness. Against creatures with darkvision, you gain concealment rather than total concealment. Your <i>shadow body</i> is incorporeal for most purposes, though you can&rsquo;t fly or pass through solid objects or creatures. However, you can move at your normal speed along any surface, including horizontal and vertical surfaces and liquids, and you are never slowed by difficult terrain. Your size doesn&rsquo;t change.
</p>

<p>
You can speak and cast spells and perform mental actions, but you have no physical substance and cannot manipulate objects or attack physically. You can deliver touch spells and effects as if making an incorporeal touch attack. Your equipment merges with your <i>shadow body</i>, so you can&rsquo;t cast spells with a material component unless those spells are prepared with Eschew Materials.

Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract&rsquo;s duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the word &ldquo;bomb admixture&rdquo; in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active.
</p>

<p>
When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, a shadowy substance is released from the bomb covering the direct target and up to three creatures that take damage from the bomb&rsquo;s splash (alchemist&rsquo;s choice). The affected creatures must successfully make a Fortitude saving throw, or they gain concealment but treat all other creatures as having concealment for the duration of the <i>shadow bomb admixture</i>. This effect does not ignore spell resistance.

You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. <i>Shadow conjuration</i> can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shadow conjuration</i>s are only one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the <i>shadow conjurations</i> to be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts with the spell can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.
</p>

<p>
Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to <i>shadow conjuration</i>&rsquo;s level (4th) rather than the spell&rsquo;s normal level. In addition, any effect created by <i>shadow conjuration</i> allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.
</p>

<p>
A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it&rsquo;s recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature&rsquo;s damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature&rsquo;s AC bonuses are just one-fifth as large.
</p>

<p>
A creature that succeeds on its save sees the <i>shadow conjurations</i> as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.

Your shadowy natural weapons are only half as strong as the real things, though creatures that believe them to be real are affected at full strength. A creature is permitted one Will save the first time you strike it. If it succeeds, the creature takes half damage from such attacks for the duration of the spell.

You conjure protective wisps of darkness made from shadow. If you are reduced below 0 hit points or rendered unconscious, <i>shadow endurance</i> immediately discharges, shunting your injured body into a hidden alcove on the Shadow Plane.

As you vanish, a quasi-real duplicate of you made from shadow substance appears where you fell, as if created by <i><a href="#Shadow Conjuration">shadow conjuration</a></i>. The duplicate acts on your initiative and is under your control. Your duplicate is 1/4 as real as you and appears with 25% of your full hit point total, and any creature that fails a Will saving throw believes it to be you. The duplicate has the same equipment-based bonuses as you, but deals only 1/4 of your normal damage against enemies. It can cast any spells you can, drawing on your reserve of magic, but the duplicate&rsquo;s caster level is 1/4 your actual level.

<p>
Using a slashing motion with the spell&rsquo;s focus as part of the casting of <i>shadow invasion</i>, you cut open a rift to the Plane of Shadow that fills a 30-foot area with shadowy energies. This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the shadow subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as <i>shadow evocation</i>) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of <i>shadow invasion</i>.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the rift created by <i>shadow invasion</i> has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When <i>shadow invasion</i> is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton will be summoned under the caster&rsquo;s command (as per <i><a href="#Summon Monster V">summon monster V</a></i>). This chance is 5% for every full round that <i>shadow invasion</i> was active. If the caster level of <i>shadow invasion</i> is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutor kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of <i>shadow invasion</i> would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors.

You instantly travel between shadows to a point within range, though line of sight is not necessary. You leave a shadowy image of yourself in your former location and are wrapped in shadow at your destination; you can attempt a Stealth check as a free action to hide in your new location. Creatures that fail opposed Perception checks typically aren&rsquo;t aware that you are no longer at your former location unless they are familiar with this spell and identify the effects. Any attack on your former location causes the shadows to disperse, allowing any creature that can see your former location to immediately notice your disappearance. In addition, for 1 round, the envelope of shadow around you grants you concealment (20% miss chance). This spell doesn&rsquo;t function if there are no shadows within 5 feet of your starting location, and you can&rsquo;t travel through your own shadow. If you choose a destination that has no shadows, you appear from the shadow closest to your destination that&rsquo;s within the spell&rsquo;s range (this could be your starting location if there are no other shadows within the spell&rsquo;s range).

With this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead shadow. Your physical body lies comatose while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow or reflection while the spell is in effect.
</p>

<p>
While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow&rsquo;s darkvision, defensive abilities, fly speed, racial stealth modifier, and strength damage attack. You do not gain the creature&rsquo;s <i>create spawn</i> ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice. Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal to your own. Your <i>shadow projection</i> has the undead type and may be turned or affected as undead.

If your <i>shadow projection</i> is slain, you return to your physical body and are immediately reduced to &minus;1 hit points. Your condition becomes dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks to stabilize.

You suffuse one subject&rsquo;s body with energy from the Shadow Plane, altering its form to match a creature from the Shadow Plane. Shadow transmutation can mimic any of the following spells: <i><a href="#Animal Growth">animal growth</a></i>, <i><a href="#Anthropomorphic Animal">anthropomorphic animal</a></i>, <i><a href="#Enlarge Person">enlarge person</a></i>, <i><a href="#Fins to Feet">fins to feet</a></i>, <i><a href="#Longarm">longarm</a></i>, <i><a href="#Polymorph">polymorph</a></i>, <i><a href="#Reduce Person">reduce person</a></i>, and <i><a href="#Stone Fist">stone fist</a></i>. If using <i>shadow transmutation</i> as <i>polymorph</i>, the target does not gain any sensory abilities that its new form has (such as low-light vision or darkvision) and the speed of any movement types gained from the spell cannot exceed the target&rsquo;s base speed or natural speed with those movement types (whichever is higher). A creature under the effects of <i>shadow transmutation</i> deals normal damage and has all the normal abilities and weaknesses of whatever form it assumes using the spell.
</p>

<p>
Any creature that interacts with a target under the effects of the spell (including attacking or being attacked by that creature) can attempt a Will save to recognize the target&rsquo;s true nature. Creatures that succeed at their Will saves to disbelieve the illusion take one-fifth (20%) of the normal damage from the target&rsquo;s natural attacks or special abilities granted by the target&rsquo;s shadowy form (if any), and the target&rsquo;s special abilities that don&rsquo;t deal damage have only a 20% chance of working against them. Creatures that succeed at their saves see the <i>shadow transmutation</i> as transparent images superimposed over the target.

<p>
To use the <i>shadow walk</i> spell, you must be in an area of dim light. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
</p>

<p>
In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
</p>

<p>
Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can&rsquo;t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It&rsquo;s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 &times; 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 &times; 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).
</p>

<p>
<i>Shadow walk</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
</p>

<p>
Any creatures touched by you when <i>shadow walk</i> is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.
</p>

<p>
They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you shape a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, success means it only takes 1 point of damage from the weapon&rsquo;s attacks. The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects.
</p>

<p>
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>shadow weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as normal.
</p>

<p>
At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 10th-level, you may increase the enhancement bonus to +2 or add the <i>frost</i> or <i>keen</i> weapon property. The <i>frost</i> and <i>keen</i> properties have no effect if the target makes its disbelief save.
</p>

<p>
The spell ends if the weapon leaves your possession.

You conjure up a quasi-real phantom singer that is visible as a shifting, shadowy duplicate of yourself. The singer follows you automatically, moving as you move even if you teleport.

The singer cannot be damaged, but can be dispelled. When a <i>shadowbard</i> comes into being, it immediately begins a bardic performance of your choice&mdash;it has access to all of the bardic performances that you do. It continues that bardic performance until you direct it as a move action to switch to a different performance. Rounds spent by a <i>shadowbard</i> creating a bardic performance do not decrease the number of rounds you can use your own bardic performance, nor can a <i>shadowbard</i>&rsquo;s bardic performance be used to trigger spells that require you to begin or cease a bardic performance.

You replace the target&rsquo;s body with mystic shadow material drawn from the Shadow Plane, rendering the target&rsquo;s physical form only quasi-real. Whenever a foe tries to directly attack the target of the spell (for instance, with a weapon or a targeted spell), that foe must attempt a Will save to disbelieve. If successful, the opponent can attack the target normally and is unaffected by <i>shadowform</i> for 1 round. If the foe fails, the target takes only one-fifth the normal amount of damage from the foe&rsquo;s successful attack or effect, and if the attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong as normal (if applicable) or only 20% as likely to occur. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell.

You dim your targets&rsquo; perceptions of light and shadow, convincing them the space they occupy is dark. Each creature that fails its save perceives the world around it as one light level darker than its true illumination level. The spell does not change the light level outside of the targets&rsquo; perception, and does not create magical darkness. However, the spell creates an illusion of darkness rather than actual darkness, so low-light and darkvision don&rsquo;t allow a target to see in the conditions created by the spell. Even targets that see normally through magical darkness suffer a loss of vision from this spell.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Rope Trick">rope trick</a></i>, except the point of entry is through a 5-foot-square instead of a rope. The space holds as many as 10 creatures of any size.
</p>

<p>
When this spell is cast upon a 5-foot-square part of a wall, it creates an extradimensional space adjacent to the Plane of Shadow. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden beyond the reach of spells (including divinations) unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as 10 creatures (of any size). The entrance to the extradimensional space remains visible as an area that is darker than the ambient illumination.
</p>

<p>
Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 5-foot-by-5-foot door or window were centered on the affected surface. The window is invisible (though it is within the shadowed entrance to the spell, which is visible), and even creatures that can see the window from the outside can&rsquo;t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space is ejected when the spell ends. Only one creature may enter or exit the extradimensional space at a time.
</p>

<p>
The entrance is only open when the area around it is in dim light. Any other level of light (brighter or darker) closes the entrance, trapping creatures inside the extradimensional space. If the entrance is closed when the spell expires, there is a 50% chance that creatures in it are ejected into the Shadow Plane instead of the location of the entrance. If this occurs, the creatures appear on the Shadow Plane 1d10 miles in a random direction from their corresponding location on the Material Plane. The spell has no effect if cast on a plane that is not adjacent to the Shadow Plane.
</p>

<p>
Because the extradimensional space is adjacent to the Shadow Plane, any <i>shadow walk</i> spell or similar effect that allows travel to the Shadow Plane is more accurate, reducing the distance creatures arrive off-target by half.

The creatures remain with you for 7 days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is 7 months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell&rsquo;s range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. You can only have one <i>shambler</i> spell in at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain where they are summoned is rainy, marshy, or damp.

The target doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between magical and nonmagical items when removing them. Each round it removes an item as determined randomly from the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, headband, shoulders, or wrists. When determining randomly, don&rsquo;t include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don&rsquo;t include items that take more than one move action to remove. Though creatures can&rsquo;t have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove. If a target is wearing clothing that doesn&rsquo;t fit in any of those slots, such as breeches or a quiver, add it to the list of possibilities at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.
</p>

<p>
The target regards the discarded items with revulsion, and if forced to touch such an item (such as with a melee or ranged touch attack using the item as an improvised weapon), the target becomes sickened for 1d3 rounds. Other than the move action to remove items, the character can take whatever actions it chooses.

You hurl a multicolored shard of congealed chaos from your holy symbol, affecting any one target in range as a ranged touch attack.
</p>

<p>
A lawful creature struck by the shard takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). A lawful outsider instead takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and is slowed (as slow) for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the slow effect. The bolt has no effect on chaotic creatures. This spell deals only half damage to creatures that are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed.

You can share your facility for one particular language with another creature. For 24 hours the target can read, understand, and communicate to the best of its ability in any one language which you already know. For every 5 levels you possess, you can grant the use of another language you know, to a maximum of 5 languages at 20th level. The target must have the physical capacity to articulate sounds, make gestures, or engage in whatever other method speakers of the language use to communicate with each other in order to actually converse. If the target lacks the mental capacity to grasp an actual language it still gains enough knowledge to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached in the language (whether written or spoken). However, since this spell does not endow the target with greater reasoning capacity, merely a temporarily enhanced vocabulary, the person offering up instructions to non-sentient creatures must take care to remove any ambiguity or guesswork.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, this spell does not affect the basic nature of the target, or its disposition toward you or anyone else, so convincing it to actually carry out these instructions could require negotiation, threats, or outright bribery.

Spending a moment in meditation and conjuring an image of the creature to mind, you reshape your link with your familiar, causing it to functions like a scrying sensor. Upon this spell you can hear, see, or smell (any one, your choice) what your familiar is experiencing. You gain the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities your familiar has tied to the chosen sense (such as low-light vision or scent), but use your own Perception skill. You don&rsquo;t need line of sight or line of effect to your familiar, but you must have an active empathic link. You may change the sense you are sharing as a standard action. Unlike other scrying spells, share senses does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it, and you are unable to see in magical or natural darkness unless your familiar possesses the ability to see in such conditions.
</p>

<p>
The sensory link with your familiar can be detected as though it were a scrying sensor.

You create a link to a target and can direct pain and damage through this link. You take only half damage from effects and attacks that deal hit point damage. The target of this spell takes the remainder of the damage. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level drain, and death effects cannot be shared through this link. If you suffer a reduction in hit points because of a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target of this spell because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned back to you.

If you and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell immediately ends.

Ithuna Vardsdottir claims to have unearthed this ancient prayer in a ruined temple of Desna, though Pathfinders have reported the use of similar magic in Irrisen among the White Witches. While the name of this spell is <i>sharesister</i>, it works equally well on male or female creatures&mdash;both targets of the spell must simply be of the same gender.
</p>

<p>
When you deliver the spell, you receive a negative level for the duration of the spell, and the other target receives a +1 insight bonus to her caster level and a +1 insight bonus to the save DCs of all of her spells. At 11th level, you can opt to take four negative levels to grant a +2 insight bonus to the other target&rsquo;s caster level and spell save DCs if you wish, while at 17th level you can take 6 negative levels to increase the insight bonus to +3. Any effect that removes or prevents the negative level immediately ends the <i>sharesister</i> spell. Negative levels received from the spell vanish as soon as this spell effect ends.

<i>Shatter</i> creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.

<p>
Used as an area attack, <i>shatter</i> destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such unattended objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are <i>shatter</i>ed.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can target <i>shatter</i> against a single solid nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), <i>shatter</i> deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.

You create a dazzling flash of electricity that fills the target area. Sheet lightning inflicts 1 point of electricity damage to all creatures within the area of effect (no save).

The sudden flash and jolt dazes living creatures for 1 round if they fail a saving throw. Creatures that save are instead dazzled for 1 round.

This spell creates a special mystical connection between you and your companion creature&mdash;animal companion, bonded mount, eidolon, or familiar&mdash;which allows you to transfer its wounds to you. The creature gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves.
</p>

<p>
As an immediate action when your companion takes damage, you can take that damage yourself to prevent your companion from being harmed (similar to <i><a href="#Shield Other">shield other</a></i>, except the damage is not split between you and the target). Forms of harm that do not involve the loss of hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level drain, and death effects, are not affected. If the creature suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, you cannot take that damage on behalf of your companion creature because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, damage directed to you by the spell is not reassigned to the subject.
</p>

<p>
If you and your companion move out of range of each other, the spell ends.

Your opponents are automatically aware of which squares you occupy, preventing you from attempting Stealth checks using this concealment unless every square adjacent to you has an illumination level of darkness or lower. <i>Shield of darkness</i> does not hinder your vision, and creatures that can see in magical darkness ignore this effect.

A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and slowing chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.
</p>

<p>
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <i>protection from chaos</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.
</p>

<p>
Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.
</p>

<p>
Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as <i><a href="#Protection from Chaos">protection from chaos</a></i> does.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is slowed (Will save negates, as the <i><a href="#Slow">slow</a></i> spell, but against <i>shield of law</i>&rsquo;s save DC).

This defensive spell must be cast on a shield you are currently wielding, and fractures the shield into two shards, plus one additional shard per 2 caster levels (to a maximum of 12 shards at 20th level). While <i>shield of shards</i> is active, you lose your shield&rsquo;s bonus to AC as its broken pieces orbit you. On your turn, you can direct the shards to attack an adjacent opponent as a move action. The shards&rsquo; attack bonus is equal to your caster level + the modifier for the ability score that determines your spell save DCs. The shards deal an amount of slashing and piercing damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per shard beyond the first, and have a threat range of 19&ndash;20. They are considered magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Additionally, if your shield is made from a special material (such as adamantine), the shards penetrate damage reduction and hardness as if they were weapons made from the same material.
</p>

<p>
At the end of this spell&rsquo;s duration, the shards reform into their original shield form. You regain its shield bonus to AC, provided you still have a free hand in which to wield it. Otherwise, the shield falls at your feet in your square.

You gain five burning wings that grant a fly speed equal to the number of wings &times; 10 (average maneuverability) for an initial fly speed of 50 feet.

This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as <i>charm</i> effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected.

You can securely communicate with one creature within range. So long as your target remains within 10 feet of you, you and it can speak freely to each other without fear of being overheard. Communications that involve <i>shield speech</i> cannot be spied on, such as with a <i>divination</i> spell, and observers of the conversation can tell you are communicating but cannot read lips or hear the conversation unless they are the target of the spell. If you or the target speak to any other creatures, they can hear you normally (only communication between you and the target is protected). The spell does not shield writing, sign language, or any form of communication other than speaking.

You cause the target to sound as if it is elsewhere within range, including its movements, speech, and all other sounds. As long as you concentrate, you can cause the sound&rsquo;s apparent location to change as you see fit within range from your current location. Once you cease concentrating, the sound moves so that it remains the same relative distance and direction from the target. This spell can fool any sound-based blindsense or blindsight (including echolocation), but it can&rsquo;t fool other forms of detection such as other forms of blindsense or blindsight, lifesense, normal vision, and tremorsense. The target receives a saving throw against the effect if it doesn&rsquo;t wish for you to shift its sound, and any creature that interacts with the illusion receives a Will save to disbelieve the glamer.

You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the area. The <i>shifting sand</i> obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the <i>shifting sand</i> must make a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws.

As a move action, you may move the area of <i>shifting sand</i> up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or prone in the spell&rsquo;s area are carried along with the <i>shifting sand</i> in the same direction if possible.

This spell does not cause affected creatures to risk accidentally attacking their allies, but it does require them to concentrate harder to keep track of their allies and foes. While this spell is in effect, every creature in the area can treat any other creature in the area as an allied threatening creature for the purpose of flanking. Further, whenever a creature in the area would provoke an attack of opportunity from an enemy, that creatures&rsquo; allies in the area must succeed at a Reflex save or lose one attack of opportunity for that round as they suppress the instinct to attack a vulnerable target that might be an ally. The shadows do not hinder precision-based attacks or create areas of dim light.

Creatures under the effect of <i>true seeing</i> are not affected by this spell. Creatures with scent or keen scent, creatures that are blind, and creatures that operate effectively without vision (such as creatures with blindsight or blindsense) are also not affected by this spell.

<p>
When you cast this spell, you make a ranged touch attack against a single opponent within 30 feet. If you hit, a thin silver strand extends from your body to its, forming a connection that allows you to anticipate its actions. For the duration of the spell, you receive a +5 insight bonus on all Perception and Sense Motive checks opposed by the target. You gain a +5 insight bonus on all Spellcraft checks made to identify your opponent&rsquo;s spell as part of a counterspelling attempt. Finally, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to your AC against attacks made against you by the target.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if either you or the target moves more than 30 feet away from the other, the cord crackles with a surge of light and sends a blast of force along its length to the other end. This blast deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6) and stuns the one who moved out of range for 1 round&mdash;a successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. This blast ends the spell and severs the connection between you and your target.
</p>

<p>
Although the <i>shining cord</i> makes a visible connection between you and your target, creatures can move through it without ill effect. The cord even passes through solid objects as necessary to maintain the connection between you and the target.

This spell creates an invisible shield similar to but not as strong as the <i>shield</i> spell. This shield hovers in front of you and negates <i>magic missile</i> attacks directed at you. The disk provides a +2 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks.

At any time, as a free action, you may dismiss your shield, at which point it deals 1d6 points of electrical damage to all creatures within a 5-foot burst, including you. A Reflex saving throw halves the damage.

You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save.

You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object&rsquo;s size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one.
</p>

<p>
Objects changed by a <i>shrink item</i> spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shrink item</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.

You imbue inanimate plants with limited mobility and a semblance of life. Each plant targeted acts as a light catapult until the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, though you must spend a standard action to aim each of these tree catapults before the first time they fire, and anytime thereafter when you want the trees to fire at a new target. The catapult uses your caster level as its targeting bonus. With a free action, you can command one or all of the trees under your command to stop firing. You do not need to supply ammunition to these tree catapults; they will automatically load themselves with rocks and boulders in the area, digging them deep from the ground if need be. You can supply the trees ammunition if you desire. The tree will not load flaming ammunition, and these catapult trees cannot be affected by <i>energy siege shot</i> if the energy selected is fire.

Upon the casting of this spell, complete <i>silence</i> prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature&rsquo;s possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a <i>silence</i> spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.

You imbue an ordinary scarf (or similar piece of clothing) with the strength of steel without altering its weight or flexibility. Each round on your turn, you can decide to use the scarf to defend yourself (gaining a +2 shield bonus to your Armor Class) or to attack as if the scarf were a whip.

This spell generates an illusory silt cloud that drifts around you and moves with you. The cloud provides total concealment to creatures within it (including you) when the spell is cast. Creatures moving into the cloud after the spell is cast gain concealment (but not total concealment) due to the illusion. Any creatures within the cloud can see each other normally and can see out from within the cloud as though it were transparent. If a creature other than you that has total concealment due to the cloud makes an attack against any foe, it loses total concealment and gains concealment instead. If you make an attack against any creature, the spell ends.
</p>

<p>
A creature that examines the cloud from the outside and succeeds at a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check notices the silt cloud is unnaturally compact and fast moving, and that creature can attempt an immediate saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. Other circumstances (such as if the silt cloud floats in the middle of otherwise clear waters) can modify the DC of the Knowledge (nature) check.
</p>

This spell can be cast only underwater.

As <i><a href="#Daylight">daylight</a></i>, except the object touched sheds bright silvery light in a 20-foot radius. In addition to providing illumination, the area of bright light is painful to creatures that are susceptible to alchemical silver. A creature with DR/silver that begins its turn within the light of this spell is automatically dazzled and becomes sickened unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. These effects disappear 1 round after the target leaves the <i>silverlight</i>. A creature that leaves the area and then returns must make a new saving throw.

<i>Simulacrum</i> creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half of the real creature&rsquo;s levels or HD (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD). You can&rsquo;t create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed by the caster&rsquo;s Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check.
</p>

<p>
At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum.

This spell attempts to transfer a magical effect from a creature you touch to yourself. When you touch the creature, <i>siphon magic</i> attempts to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on that creature, as if via a targeted <i><a href="#Dispel Magic">dispel magic</a></i>. If you know the specific spell effect you wish to target, you can name that spell effect to target that specific spell; otherwise <i>siphon magic</i> begins with the highest-level spell in effect and works its way down through all spells affecting the target until it dispels one or runs out of effects, as per <i>dispel magic</i>.
</p>

<p>
If <i>siphon magic</i> successfully ends a spell effect on the target, the remaining duration of that spell effect is transferred to you. That spell effect plays out for the rest of its duration as if you had been the original target. If the spell allows a saving throw to resist the effect, you gain a saving throw as if the spell were just being cast upon you, although this does not &ldquo;reset&rdquo; the spell&rsquo;s duration.

This spell turns corpses into skeletons that act as crew and obey your commands to the extent of their abilities.
</p>

<p>
The undead you create are 1 Hit Die skeletons that possess Profession (sailor) scores equal to half your character level plus your Wisdom modifier (for clerics), Intelligence modifier (for witches and wizards), or Charisma modifier (for sorcerers and summoners). Each skeleton can perform the duties of one crew member but has no other abilities. The created skeletons cannot speak, attack, or even defend themselves. The only orders they obey are ones pertaining to the operation of a ship. Skeletal crew members are not proficient with any weapons or armor.
</p>

<p>
You can&rsquo;t create more Hit Dice of skeletal crew members than twice your caster level with a single casting of <i>skeleton crew</i>. The <i>desecrate</i> spell doubles this limit.
</p>

<p>
The undead you create by casting <i>skeleton crew</i> remain under your control for the duration of the spell, and do not count against your limit of total Hit Dice worth of undead creatures you can control.
</p>

<p>
A skeletal crew member can only be created from a mostly intact humanoid corpse. The corpse must have bones. When you cast this spell, any flesh left on the corpses melts away into fog.

You mix a malign spirit into a piece of food, a drink, or some other item to be consumed (including alchemical items, potions, elixirs, or similar items). The <i>skin tag</i> spell discharges when the item is consumed, affecting the creature that used the item unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. The spirit embeds itself somewhere in the affected creature&rsquo;s skin, forming a painless set of wrinkles and tags of skin that looks vaguely like a face when the haunt activates. You are considered to have a body part from the affected creature for the purpose of <i>scrying</i> and similar divination spells. Once per day as a standard action, you can remotely cause the spirit to make the affected creature&rsquo;s skin crawl, causing the creature to become sickened for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per 2 caster levels you have (to a maximum of 5 extra rounds at 10th level) unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. Alternatively, once per day you can remotely use a hex, a mind-affecting spell, or a necromancy spell that causes disease or possession on the affected creature. Each time you use the remote sickening or spell or hex effect, the spell&rsquo;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.

You cause your own skin to peel off your body and animate as a magical creature you control. You may project your consciousness to your animated skin or return it to your actual body as a standard action. When your consciousness is in your body, you are helpless (except for transferring your will to your skin, or dismissing the spell).
</p>

<p>
Your possessed skin is identical to you in all ways, except the following: It has only half the number of hit points you had at the time you cast the spell, and cannot be healed above this maximum; construct type, traits, and immunities; Str 3, Con &mdash;; DR 10/piercing or slashing; and compression (as the universal monster ability. Your skin can take any actions you could normally take in your own body (such as to fight or cast spells).
</p>

<p>
When your skin leaves your body, your body&rsquo;s hit points drop to 0. Your body cannot heal damage naturally while you have no skin, nor do spells that cure hit point damage work on your body; only regeneration (from a <i>regenerate</i> spell, <i>ring of regeneration</i>, the regeneration monster ability, or any other effect that can regrow missing limbs) or <i>heal</i> can regrow your skin and allow you to heal above 0 hit points.
</p>

<p>
If your body is regenerated before your skin returns to it, the skin dies and your consciousness returns automatically to your body. Your skin can be preserved with <i>gentle repose</i> and is suitable for any purpose that requires some of your flesh (such as a <i>resurrection</i> spell) or any magic or ritual that requires a creature&rsquo;s skin.
</p>

<p>
When your skin returns to your body, you regain hit points equal to your skin&rsquo;s remaining hit points. If the spell ends before you reunite with your skin or if your skin is killed while you are in your body, you remain helpless and at 0 hit points until your full body is restored to you (requiring powerful magic, as described above). If your body dies while you are possessing your skin, you die when the spell ends, regardless of how many hit points the skin has left. If your body or skin is slain with your consciousness in it, the spell ends and you are instantly killed.
</p>

<p>
This spell leaves long scars on your skin where it split apart, although these fade normally with the use of healing magic.

The caster designates the area of a hemisphere within the spell&rsquo;s range. If a solid object would block the creation of the hemisphere (such as a ceiling or wall), the spell instead conforms to the geometry of the location up to the maximum area of effect for the spell. The hemisphere displays an image of the sky as it appears directly above where the spell was cast. This effect bypasses natural impediments, such as rock or stone, that would obstruct the targeted location from the sky.
</p>

<p>
The image of the sky created by this spell counts as the actual sky for purposes of effects that require view of the sky, sun, stars, or other features (including for spell preparation or deific obediences). It does not enable spells or effects that draw effects from the sky (such as <i>call lightning</i>).

This spell allows you to reach into an evil creature&rsquo;s mind to expose and exploit its susceptibility to whichever of the seven so-called &ldquo;deadly sins&rdquo; it is most susceptible to. The targeted creature must succeed at a Will save or it is overwhelmed with an inability to repress urges to indulge in whatever sin most closely mirrors its personality, and a glowing rune appears upon the creature&rsquo;s body (usually the brow), identifying the sin. (The GM adjudicates which rune manifests on the creature&rsquo;s body, as appropriate.) Each round, at the start of its turn, the target must attempt a new Will saving throw against the spell&rsquo;s DC to resist the sin&rsquo;s enslavement. If the target succeeds at this saving throw, it is sickened for that round by the distractions of its sin. If it fails, it is sickened and staggered as it spends part of its action wallowing in its targeted sin (a wrathful victim might waste time spouting threats and profanity, while a slothful victim might merely be slow and hesitant, and a lustful victim could well spend precious moments ogling or fawning over something of beauty).

A <i>sleep</i> spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell&rsquo;s point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). <i>Sleep</i> does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

<p>
You compel an unconscious or sleeping creature to rise and move in a half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or guided, but remains helpless for all other purposes.
</p>

<p>
The subject moves at half speed and is limited to a single move action each round. It is not capable of moving at a higher rate of speed or taking actions other than movement except by magical assistance, and automatically fails any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks. If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking it must make a new saving throw or the spell ends and the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must be awoken normally. While <i>sleepwalk</i> allows an unconscious creature to move, it does not awaken the creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise heal them. A disabled creature that moves about while under the effects of this spell does not start dying again as a result of this movement.

<p>
You compel the target creature to rise from its sleep as if sleepwalking and perform a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The spell takes effect immediately if the target is already asleep, or as soon as the target falls asleep if it is conscious. You can specify that the creature should wait before taking action when you give your instructions if you so choose. A sleeping creature doesn&rsquo;t get a save against this spell. The suggested activity must not cause the target to directly harm itself or others, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be reasonable. For example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or poison its ally&rsquo;s rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de grace action against a sleeping ally. Instructions that cause direct harm prompt the target to awaken just prior to performing the action and the target experiences a vague memory of what it was supposed to do.
</p>

<p>
The target moves at its speed, but isn&rsquo;t capable of running or moving at a higher rate of speed. It moves in dark conditions as if it had darkvision and can perform most simple and skill-based actions, but it can&rsquo;t engage in combat, spellcasting, or actions that require significant cognitive awareness (like making complex decisions, solving puzzles, or using complicated magic items). If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking, it must attempt a new saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell ends and the creature awakens. When the target completes the suggested course of activity, or when the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and returns to where it was sleeping and must be awoken normally. It retains no memory of what it did while unconscious (with the only exception described above).
</p>

<p>
Unlike the <i>sleepwalk</i> spell, attempts to use <i>sleepwalking suggestion</i> on a creature that is unconscious for any reason other than sleep automatically fail. A creature affected by <i>sleepwalking suggestion</i> is unaware it has been programmed to act in its sleep (unless awoken because it was about to cause harm).

You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a <i><a href="#Slow">slow</a></i> spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the <i>slow</i> effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as <i>create water</i> or <i>hydraulic push</i>) removes all the mud in 1 round.

You cause your target to become overwhelmed by its own importance, talents, and attractiveness. The target cannot help but look at itself in every reflective surface at every possible opportunity. In social situations, the target always tries to comment about how attractive it is or how ugly someone else is by comparison. The target remains constantly distracted, always looking for a reflective surface to gaze upon (such as a mirror, pool of water, a polished shield, and so on). The distraction gives the target a &minus;2 penalty on all skill checks. In combat, the target worries about enemies damaging its appearance, and focuses on defense rather than offense (casting defensive spells rather than offensive spells, using the fight defensively or total defense action, and so on).

A favorite display at halfling midsummer festivals, this spell lets you create fireworks in the shape of tiny dragons.
</p>

<p>
Once per round, as a move action, you may designate a target 5-foot-square within range and launch a pyrotechnic in that direction. The pyrotechnic takes a zigzag path from you to that square, always missing creatures and objects in its path, and detonates in that square with a bang and a colorful burst of fire and light. Creatures in the target square take 1d4 points of fire damage and are dazzled for 1 round (Reflex half, a successful save negates the dazzled condition).
</p>

<p>
Normally when this spell is used as part of a festival, the chosen target is high in the sky to increase visibility and protect observers.

<p>
This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast <i>snare</i> upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
</p>

<p>
If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare> can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
</p>

<p>
The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.

<p>
In frozen northern lands, where the earth may be hidden beneath heavy drifts of snow, Ulfen druids developed a variation of <i>stone shape</i> that other spellcasters have since learned.
</p>

<p>
You can form a mass of snow into any shape that suits your purpose, as per the spell <i><a href="#Stone Shape">stone shape</a></i>. While it&rsquo;s possible to make crude objects with <i>snow shape</i>, most fine details aren&rsquo;t possible. However, a successful Craft (weapons) check allows you to create a bladed weapon from the snow. The DC of this check is equal to the DC listed with the Craft (weapons) skill. You must be the one to make the Craft check and must do so at the time of casting this spell. A failed check means that the spell is cast normally but the weapon created is malformed and useless. This spell can only be used to craft weapons and not more precise tools or elaborate armors.
</p>

<p>
Once you create the item with this spell, it solidifies into super-hard ice, gaining a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. This weapon takes double damage from fire. Anyone using an ice weapon takes a &minus;2 penalty on attacks due to the slippery, unwieldy nature of the weapon, but the weapon deals 1 point of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. A weapon created by this spell lasts for 24 hours before melting into uselessness.

<p>
When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell&rsquo;s area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected.
</p>

<p>
A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can&rsquo;t run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can&rsquo;t run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.
</p>

<p>
While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected.
</p>

<p>
Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls (treat as a cave-in with no bury zone, see Chapter 13).
</p>

<p>
A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Fog Cloud">fog cloud</a></i>, but in addition to obscuring sight, the <i>solid fog</i> is so thick that it impedes movement.
</p>

<p>
Creatures moving through a <i>solid fog</i> move at half their normal speed and take a &minus;2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into <i>solid fog</i> is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in <i>solid fog</i>. <i>Solid fog</i>, and effects that work like <i>solid fog</i>, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.
</p>

<p>
Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.
</p>

<p>
<i>Solid fog</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>solid fog</i> dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

<p>
You give temporary physical form to a single musical note and can hang it, suspended, wherever you wish within range, allowing you to use it as hook, pulley, door blocker, or anything else your imagination desires. The exact appearance of the <i>solid note</i> depends on your melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple or convoluted, and with any color pattern you wish, however, it always has a size approximately equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the <i>solid note</i> resists all attempts to move it but instantly disappears if enough force or weight is brought to bear against it. The note has an effective Strength equal to 10 + your caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a heavy load for its Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note is holding shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can never deal actual harm to a creature and disappears if successfully attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma modifier) or overcome with a combat maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the <i>solid note</i> simply fails to budge it and loses that action for the round.

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature&rsquo;s behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced by a <i>song of discord</i> to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.

Upon casting this spell, you keep your relative shape, but you and your equipment are transformed into semisolid sound. While in this sonic form, you take no penalties for squeezing, and you can move through spaces without penalty as if you were a creature three size categories smaller. You can make a melee touch attack once per round that deals 1d6 points of sonic damage + 1 point per caster level. You are considered incorporeal (although you cannot move through solid objects). Any nonmagical attacks you make deal half damage. Magical attacks are unaffected, and you can use your magic items and other equipment as normal.
</p>

<p>
You cannot enter an area of <i>silence</i>. If you are in the area of a <i>silence</i> spell, you take 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level of the <i>silence</i> spell in the round it is cast and in each round when you end your turn within the spell&rsquo;s area. You can attempt a Fortitude saving throw each round to take half damage.

You produce a sweeping rush of sound that can hurl creatures or objects away from you, like the violent thrust version of <i><a href="#Telekinesis">telekinesis</a></i>. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that is within range; it flies in a straight line away from you. Any objects of creatures thrown must be within 10 feet of each other. You can hurl a total weight of up to 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).
</p>

<p>
You can use this spell to hurl an object or creature toward a particular target. You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a bard or sorcerer). Hurled weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.
</p>

<p>
Creatures that fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.
</p>

<p>
If a hurled creature is thrown against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).

You create an area of healing mud. Water, earth, sand, and dust thicken into a wet mud. The mud functions as difficult terrain and does not sink if created in water unless weighed down by more than 100 pounds per caster level you have. Each round a creature begins its turn in or on the mud, the mud restores 1 hit point to it; this healing is unaffected by effects that increase a creature&rsquo;s healing. A creature that rests partially or completely submerged in this mud for 1 full minute is also healed of 1d4 points of ability damage to an ability score of its choice.

You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a black sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than 1 round per caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned through <i>clone</i>, <i>raise dead</i>, <i>reincarnation</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>, or even a <i>miracle</i> or a <i>wish.</i> Only by destroying the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul (which is then still dead).

The focus for this spell is a black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp value for every HD possessed by the creature whose soul is to be bound.

It does not work on creatures formed from souls or planar material (such as most outsiders). <i>Soul transfer</i> is mainly used to transfer souls from one receptacle to another, but it can also be used to capture vulnerable souls that aren&rsquo;t bound to mortal flesh (such as incorporeal creatures and petitioners).

This spell protects the target&rsquo;s soul by briefly enveloping the target in an ethereal vault. The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects that would trap or redirect its soul (such as <i>magic jar</i>, <i>soul bind</i>, and <i>trap the soul</i>) and effects that would transform the target into an undead creature. The target is granted a save to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. If it&rsquo;s cast on a living creature that then dies, the target&rsquo;s body and spirit are protected by the spell for its duration. If it&rsquo;s cast on a corpse within 1 round of death, the target&rsquo;s body and soul are both protected. Otherwise, only the body receives the protection.
</p>

<p>
Any spellcaster that worships Abadar may learn and cast <i>soul vault</i> as a 4th level spell, if it isn&rsquo;t normally on her class spell list. <i>Soul vault</i> can be made permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell at a cost of 7,500 gp and a minimum caster level of 11th.

You identify the stage of a given soul&rsquo;s judgment, or determine its fate post-judgment. You must either unambiguously identify the soul you seek or use the skull of the body the soul vacated as a focus. If the subject does not share your alignment, the soul can attempt a Will save to resist this spell&rsquo;s effects as if it were still alive. If the subject is still alive or its soul has been destroyed, this spell fails without providing any information.
</p>

<p>
If the soul has not yet been judged and moved on to its final reward or punishment, <i>soulseeker</i> provides an estimate of its location; in most cases, this is somewhere in the River of Souls or the Boneyard. While this may assist in physically traveling to the soul&rsquo;s location, especially in cases involving effects such as <i>soul bind</i> or a devourer&rsquo;s devour soul ability, the spell&rsquo;s primary purpose is to identify how long the subject has been dead (and what form of life-restoring magic is necessary). If the soul has already been judged, <i>soulseeker</i> instead identifies the plane to which the soul has been sent as a petitioner and the petitioner&rsquo;s general location on that plane (such as &ldquo;Elysium, beneath the boughs of the Witchwood&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
If <i>soulseeker</i> is cast on the same plane on which the soul&rsquo;s new petitioner form currently exists, it guides you along the shortest, most direct physical route to the petitioner, as described in <i><a href="#Find the Path">find the path</a></i>. In this case, the spell&rsquo;s duration is 1 hour per level.

You may only cast this spell if you currently have a familiar. You place your soul into the body of your familiar, and your familiar&rsquo;s soul is placed in your body. This functions as if you possessed your familiar using <i><a href="#Magic Jar">magic jar</a></i>; your familiar simultaneously possesses your body in the same manner. You can&rsquo;t freely transfer your soul between your body and your familiar&rsquo;s&mdash;if you choose to return to your body as a standard action, the spell ends. If either body is killed, both spirits return to their original bodies, the spell ends, and the original owner of the slain body dies.

You create an invisible barrier that surrounds you and moves with you, inhibiting one category of magic. When you cast this spell, choose either arcane or divine magic. This spell functions like <i><a href="#Antimagic Field">antimagic field</a></i>, but it suppresses only spells of the chosen type and supernatural and spell-like class abilities from classes that grant spellcasting of the selected type. Magic items, other spell-like abilities, and other supernatural abilities are unaffected.
</p>

<p>
While this spell is in effect, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC 20 + twice the spell level) to cast any spell, whether arcane or divine. If you fail at the check, you lose the spell as if you had cast it to no effect.

You plant an idea, concept, or suspicion in the mind of the subject. The target genuinely believes that the idea is his own, but is not required to act upon it. If the idea is contrary to the target&rsquo;s normal thoughts (such as making a paladin think, &ldquo;I should murder my friends&rdquo;) the target may suspect mind-altering magic is at play. The idea must be fairly clear, enough so that it can be conveyed in one or two sentences. You do not need to share a common language for the spell to succeed, but without a common language you can only sow the most basic rudimentary ideas.

<p>
Having attained the highest and most profane form of magical achievement in the Great Destroyer&rsquo;s service, you are able to call forth his most dreaded creations: the Spawn of Rovagug.
</p>

<p>
Casting this spell requires a week-long ritual involving the sacrifice of one or more sentient humanoid creatures that between them possess a total of at least 15 Hit Dice. You may not eat, sleep, or cast any other spells for the duration of this ritual. After the third day of the ritual, you must succeed at a Constitution check on each remaining day of the ritual (DC 10 + 1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hunger. At the end of the ritual, you gain the exhausted condition from lack of sleep.
</p>

<p>
Upon completion of the ritual, the ground rumbles in a 100-foot radius centered on you. This effect lasts for 1 round. Any creature on the ground in this area that attempts to cast a spell during this round must succeed at a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell. Any creature on the ground in the area that attempts to attack or move during this round must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save at the beginning of its turn or fall prone.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of your next turn, a massive fissure full of dark fire and shrieking cries appears at a point you designate within the spell&rsquo;s range, and a Spawn of Rovagug emerges.
</p>

<p>
This creature takes the form of a thunder behemoth with the advanced and entropic simple templates. Unlike with <i>summon monster</i> or similar spells, the caster has no control whatsoever over the called creature. The spawn immediately heads in a random direction or toward an obvious target such as a population center, destroying anything in its path, yourself and your allies included.
</p>

<p>
Any creature may attempt to control the called Spawn of Rovagug via spells like <i>dominate monster</i> or <i>binding</i>.
</p>

<p>
However, if such an attempt fails, it draws the spawn&rsquo;s attention, and the monster immediately tries to destroy the creature that attempted to control it.
</p>

<p>
Because the Spawn of Rovagug are all magical beasts native to the Material Plane, spells such as <i>banishment</i> or <i>dismissal</i> have no effect on the called spawn.

<p>
The target becomes resistant to the effects of energy drain and blood drain attacks made by undead creatures, and cannot be made into undead spawn if killed while the spell is in effect.
</p>

<p>
If the attacking undead&rsquo;s Hit Dice is less than or equal to your caster level, the blood drain or energy drain has no effect. If the attacking undead&rsquo;s Hit Dice are greater than your caster level, the undead must make a Fortitude save (against the DC of the spell) with each attack for those special abilities to have any effect. The spell only prevents the Constitution damage from blood drain and negative levels from energy drain, but not any other effects of these attacks.

You must select the language at the time of casting. The language can&rsquo;t be a dead language, such as Ancient Osiriani or Jistka.

You grant the semblance of life to a corpse, allowing it to answer questions. You may ask one question per two caster levels. The corpse&rsquo;s knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you in life.
</p>

<p>
If the dead creature&rsquo;s alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.
</p>

<p>
If successful, the corpse can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you, using Bluff. The soul can only speak about what it knew in life. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after its death.
</p>

<p>
If the corpse has been subject to <i>speak with dead</i> within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

<p>
You stir a haunt to a limited sense of awareness and consciousness, allowing it to answer questions. The spell&rsquo;s range must reach any square within 10 feet of the haunt&rsquo;s area. You must be aware of the haunt prior to casting the spell, and casting the spell does not trigger the haunt. You can ask one question per 2 caster levels. The haunt&rsquo;s knowledge is limited to what its original creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke. A haunt often remembers the circumstance that led to its existence (though this recollection might be from the original victim&rsquo;s perspective and therefore not objective), what triggers it, and how it can be laid to rest (destroyed). Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the haunt is angry and vindictive.
</p>

<p>
If the haunt&rsquo;s alignment is more than one step away from yours, the haunt can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A haunt&rsquo;s Will save modifier is equal to 3 + the haunt&rsquo;s CR. If the save is successful, the haunt can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you (using Bluff). A haunt&rsquo;s Bluff modifier equals its CR (minimum +0) or might be determined by the GM based upon the original victim. The haunt can speak only about what it knew in life and the circumstances by which it became a haunt. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after it was created. A neutral or good haunt might cooperate with similarly aligned creatures in order to end its suffering.
</p>

<p>
If a haunt has been subject to this spell within the past week, a new casting of this spell on it fails. You can cast this on a haunt that has been deceased for any amount of time.  Unlike a corpse affected by <i>speak with dead</i>, a haunt wants to express itself, if only to share its pain or to cause mischief.

<p>
You tap into the awareness and consciousness of a plane with a sentient structure, allowing it to answer questions. A tangible manifestation of the plane (such as the ground) must be within the spell&rsquo;s range upon casting. You can ask the sentient plane one question per 2 caster levels. If the plane&rsquo;s alignment is at least one step away from yours, the plane can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A plane typically has a +20 bonus on Will saves, and a demiplane typically has a +15 bonus on Will saves. A plane&rsquo;s traits can further affect these bonuses: a mildly aligned plane receives a +2 bonus, and a strongly aligned plane or a plane with the wild magic trait receives a +4 bonus on its save.
</p>

<p>
If a plane has been subject to this spell within the past week, a new casting of this spell targeting the same plane fails. If speak with plane targets a plane that does not have a sentient structure, the spell fails.

The spell doesn&rsquo;t make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments.

You commune with the soul of a dead creature.

The soul can attempt a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.

<p>
A soul contacted this way can speak normally in any language it knows. Unlike <i>speak with dead</i> and similar spells, you are not limited to asking questions and can engage in normal conversation with the soul (and vice versa). The soul isn&rsquo;t an undead creature and isn&rsquo;t compelled to speak or be truthful. Generally, the soul only knows what it knew in life, although souls that persisted with awareness of their surroundings after death may have more to offer.

<p>
A ghostly hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the <i>spectral hand</i>. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if it goes beyond the spell range or goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers.
</p>

<p>
The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of 22 (+8 size, +4 natural armor). Your Intelligence modifier applies to the hand&rsquo;s AC as if it were the hand&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.

This spell creates a spectral saluqi, an undead canine resembling an oversized hound with black fur, a gray ruff and tail, and milky gray eyes. The hound shares your alignment and can converse with you telepathically. It can see and attack ethereal creatures, and otherwise has the same statistics as a yeth hound. It usually leaves no tracks because it prefers to fly an inch above the ground. You are immune to the hound&rsquo;s bay ability. The hound&rsquo;s bite is considered aligned to any single alignment you possess for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

<p>
You summon a spectral creature in the shape of the Tiny or smaller animal of your choice, which always appears in your square. The creature emits a faint glow of a color you choose at the time of the spell&rsquo;s casting, providing the illumination of a candle. It has the same statistics as the creature after which it is modeled (including ability scores, Armor Class, feats, senses, skills, and speed), but is incorporeal and has only 1 hit point. A spectral scout cannot attack, but can otherwise follow any basic instructions that could be given to a pet or animal companion of similar intelligence but without the need to make Handle Animal skill checks.
</p>

<p>
A spectral scout can communicate verbally with the caster but can&rsquo;t be understood by others. A spectral scout can relay information it has directly witnessed with perfect clarity, including sights, sounds, and smells, but it cannot further interpret that information. For example, a spectral scout can report on how many individuals it sees, the direction they are going, and what equipment they carry; it can&rsquo;t tell the caster whether the people were friend or foe, or their objective.

If a creature within 100 feet that you can see is speaking a language you understand, you can read its lips with perfect accuracy. Reading lips in this manner gives the exact wording of conversation and does not assist in deciphering any obfuscated ideas such as secret messages or slang. Reading lips requires moderate concentration, and you take a &minus;4 penalty on other Perception checks while doing so.

<i>Speechreader&rsquo;s sight</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell cast by a caster of 9th level or higher, at a cost of 2,500 gp.

You immediately discover some of the spells that the target knows or has prepared. The number of spells revealed to you is equal to your caster level. The target&rsquo;s lowest-level spells are revealed first&mdash;ignoring 0-level spells&mdash;in a random order. Once all of the target&rsquo;s 1st-level spells are revealed, the spell begins revealing 2nd-level spells, then 3rd-level spells. This spell does not reveal spells of 4th level or higher, nor does it reveal spelllike abilities or other special abilities. If cast on a creature that is not a spellcaster, that has only 0-level spells or spells of 4th level or higher prepared, that has expended all of its spells, or that has not prepared any spells that day, the spell has no effect.

The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn&rsquo;t protect a creature from spells for which spell resistance doesn&rsquo;t apply. <i>Spell immunity</i> protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks.
</p>

<p>
Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. A creature can have only one <i>spell immunity</i> or greater <i>spell immunity</i> spell in effect on it at a time.

A whip of cracking magical might appears in your hand, allowing you lash spells from the mind of enemy spellcasters. With a lash of bluish-purple energy, you strip many protective spells and effects from a single creature. If the target of this spell is currently under the effects of any harmless spells or effects, it must succeed at a Will save or all of those spells and effects end, stripping the target of the benefit of those spells. If the target is not currently under the effect of least one harmless spell, the target is instead confused for 1d4 rounds.

Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. <i>Spell turning</i> also fails to stop touch range spells. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly.
</p>

<p>
When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of <i>spell turning</i> you have left, that spell is partially turned. Subtract the amount of <i>spell turning</i> left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be the one who is affected. If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by <i>spell turning</i> effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result.

This spell functions exactly like <i><a href="#Imbue with Spell Ability">imbue with spell ability</a></i>, except that you can imbue the target with any spell you have prepared (instead of just abjuration, divination, or conjuration &#91;healing&#93; spells) and the target may have more than one use of the imbued spells, depending upon the arrangements made when it is cast.
</p>

<p>
Casting this spell requires a contract between you and the target, explaining what spells are to be imbued and the circumstances that cause the contract to expire. The contract may be as simple as allowing the target one casting of each of the imbued spells (as per <i>imbue with spell ability</i>), or may continue for multiple days or even indefinitely, with the target regaining use of the imbued spells when you next prepare your own spells. You may include any proviso you see fit, such as requiring the target to pray to Asmodeus each morning, or restricting the target to only casting the imbued spells on himself. If the target does not agree to all the conditions in the contract, this spell fails when cast. The contract (and this spell) automatically expires if you or the target dies. While the contract remains in effect, you gain a profane bonus to your Armor Class, saving throws, and checks equal to the highestlevel spell you have imbued.
</p>

<p>
Once you cast this spell, you cannot prepare a new 5th-level spell to replace it until the contract expires. If the number of 5th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active <i>lesser spellcasting contract</i> spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.
</p>

<p>
Unlike <i>imbue with spell ability</i>, how the target uses the spell has no reflection on your alignment or relationship with Asmodeus; the Prince of Darkness accepts that allowing another access to his magic for good may benefit his plans in the long run. Note that unlike <i>imbue with spell ability</i>, you cannot dismiss this spell; you must abide by the contract&rsquo;s termination clause (though the contract may include a proviso for at-will nullification by either or both parties). This spell cannot be combined with <i>imbue with spell ability</i> or similar spells to give a target more spells than the limit.
</p>

<p>
<i>Example:</i> You cast this spell on your 5 HD fighter cohort after negotiating an appropriate contract, imbuing him with the ability to cast cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, and <i>shield of faith</i> once per day for 1 month. If he casts any of these spells, he recovers them when you prepare your spells. Until the contract ends, your 5th-level spell slot used to cast this spell remains expended and cannot be filled with a new spell. Because you imbued your cohort with a 2nd-level spell, you gain a +2 profane bonus to attacks, saves, and checks while the contract remains in effect.

If the target prepares spells, it must choose one of its prepared 3rd-level spells, which is immediately lost; if the target has no 3rd-level spells prepared, it must lose a 2nd-level spell it has prepared (progressing down to a 1st-level spell if it has no 2nd-level spells prepared).

If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, it loses one of its available 3rd-level spell slots; if the target has no available 3rd-level spell slots, it must lose a 2nd-level spell slot (progressing down to a 1st-level spell slot if it has no 2nd-level spell slots available).
</p>

<p>
There is no initial saving throw for this spell, but the target can attempt a Will save each round at the end of its turn.

<p>
If the target has more than one spellcasting class, choose one at random to be affected. This spell has no effect on spell-like abilities.
</p>

<p>
Any spell or spell slot lost because of this spell is treated as if the caster had failed a concentration check while trying to cast it&mdash;the spell or the spell slot is wasted and has no effect, but is recovered normally the next time the character prepares spells or regains spell slots.

This potent spell invokes the same sort of magical devastation that created the Mana Wastes so long ago&mdash;albeit on a much more localized (and thankfully temporary) scale. Within the area you choose to affect with <i>spellscar</i>, the terrain takes on a strange pale hue, as if colors were muted. Periodically, ripples of vibrant color wriggle through the terrain. Within this area, any spell, spell-like ability, or magic item activation automatically triggers a primal magic event&mdash;a spellcaster can avoid triggering such an event by making a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell&rsquo;s level), but non-spellcasters who activate magic items have no such option.

You store one spell that you can normally cast in a wooden quarterstaff. Only one such spell can be stored in a staff at a given time, and you cannot have more than one <i>spellstaff</i> at any given time. You can cast a spell stored within a staff just as though it were among those you had prepared, but it does not count against your normal allotment for a given day. You use up any applicable material components required to cast the spell when you store it in the <i>spellstaff</i>.

You create a discordant blast of energy that disrupts the target&rsquo;s available magic and transfers knowledge of that magic to you.
</p>

<p>
If the target prepares spells, it must choose one of its prepared 3rd-level spells, which is immediately lost. If the target has no 3rd-level spells prepared, it loses a 2nd-level spell it has prepared. This progresses down to a 1st-level spell if the target has no 2nd-level spells prepared, and this spell has no effect if the target also has no 1st-level spells prepared. If the spell is on your spell list, you can cast this lost spell (using your caster level) on your next turn.
</p>

<p>
If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, it loses one of its available 3rd-level spell slots. If the target has no available 3rd-level spell slots, it must lose a 2nd-level spell slot (progressing as above). Randomly select one of the target&rsquo;s spells known of that spell level; if that spell is on your spell list, you can cast it (using your caster level) on your next turn.

You must provide any focus or material components to cast the stolen spell.

Any spell or spell slot lost because of this spell is treated as if the caster had failed a concentration check while trying to cast&mdash;the spell or spell slot is wasted and has no effect, but it is recovered normally the next time the character prepares spells or regains spell slots.

You create a luminescent sphere of orbiting energy that harms incorporeal creatures and dispossesses them of any stolen bodies. An incorporeal creature must succeed at a Will save to enter a space overlapping with the sphere; failure means the creature cannot pass through the sphere, as though it were a <i><a href="#Wall of Force">wall of force</a></i>. If the incorporeal creature succeeds, it may pass through the sphere at will, though if it ends its turn within the sphere, it takes a number of points of force damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).
</p>

<p>
If a creature possessing another creature&rsquo;s body (via either <i>magic jar</i> or a similar effect) enters a <i>sphere of warding</i>, that creature is immediately ejected from its host body, the host&rsquo;s spirit returns to its body if it&rsquo;s able, and the possession immediately ends. When ejected, the body enters the sphere, while the possessing creature takes the appropriate amount of force damage (no save) and is shunted to the exterior of the sphere.

This spell allows remote viewing through spheres that have previously consumed some portion of the spellcaster&rsquo;s body: a single digit of a finger or toe at a minimum. The caster can view and listen to events within a 20-foot radius of the associated sphere; this radius follows the sphere if the sphere moves. Unlike a true <i>scrying</i> spell, no other spells operate through the associated sphere, but <i>spherescry</i> produces no indication of its activity on the target and cannot be discovered by normal methods of magical detection.

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner.

Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell&rsquo;s area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance.

<p>
In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, <i>spike growth</i> can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell&rsquo;s area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.

<p>
Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by half. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a <i>cure</i> spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell&rsquo;s save DC.

Magic traps are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <i>spike growth</i>. The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 28 for <i>spike growth</i> (or DC 27 for <i>spike growth</i> cast by a ranger). <i>Spike growth</i> can&rsquo;t be disabled with the Disable Device skill.

Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs.

You heighten your awareness of up to one willing creature or object per 3 caster levels, each of which must be within 30 feet of you during the entire hour you spend preparing spells and casting <i>spirit bonds</i>. By concentrating on one of these creatures or objects as a full-round action, you can learn its direction and relative distance from your location, provided that it is on the same plane. In the case of a creature, you can also learn the state of its emotion or health aura as a full-round action. In the case of an object, you can also get a sense of how damaged it is, similar to reading the health aura of a creature, or, in the case of a magic item that must be activated, you can learn when it was last activated (a full-round action in either case).

<p>
An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god.
</p>

<p>
The <i>spiritual ally</i> occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The <i>spiritual ally</i> carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for <i>spiritual weapon</i>), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your <i>spiritual ally</i> can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The <i>spiritual ally</i> threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The <i>spiritual ally</i> uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the <i>spiritual ally</i> hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures.
</p>

<p>
Each round after the first, you can move the <i>spiritual ally</i> as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the <i>spiritual ally</i> cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>a sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual ally</i>&rsquo;s AC against touch attacks is 10.
</p>

<p>
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual ally</i> strikes it. If the ally is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

<p>
This spell causes an ally made of pure force to appear in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god (if any) or an ancestor. The spiritual squire occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. While the spiritual squire appears to wear armor and carry a weapon, it cannot make attacks and does not threaten any spaces. On your turn, the spiritual squire can do one of the following: retrieve one stowed item from your possessions, carry an object weighing no more than 10 pounds per caster level, hand you an object it is carrying, perform the aid another action on your behalf or for one of your allies, or help one creature of your choice don armor (which then takes half the normal time). When the spiritual squire attempts the aid another action in combat, its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier.
</p>

<p>
Each round after the first as a swift action, you can order the spiritual squire to move. It has a speed of 30 feet. Being a construct of force, the spiritual squire cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, a <i>rod of cancellation</i>, or a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> affects it. A spiritual ally&rsquo;s AC against touch attacks is 10.

<p>
A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some <i>spiritual</i> significance or symbolism to you; see below and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.
</p>

<p>
Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round&rsquo;s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell&rsquo;s range, not the weapon&rsquo;s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.
</p>

<p>
A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>&rsquo;s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).
</p>

<p>
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
</p>

<p>
The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity&rsquo;s own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon</i> of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law (longsword).

<p>
Choose a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower with a casting time of 1 standard action or less. As part of the action of casting <i>spite</i>, you cast the associated spell and bind it into a defensive ward in the form of a tattoo, birthmark, or wart somewhere upon your body. The next time you are hit by a melee attack or a combat maneuver is used successfully against you, the stored spell is triggered against your foe. You do not need to succeed on a touch attack to affect the target, but in all other respects the spell is treated as though you had cast it normally. If the attacking creature is not a valid target for the spell, the stored spell is lost with no effect.
</p>

You can have only one <i>spite</i> spell in effect at a time; if you cast this spell a second time, the previous spell effect ends.

You create an aura around the target weapon that weakens a foe&rsquo;s magical defenses. The first time each round the weapon damages a creature with spell resistance, that creature&rsquo;s spell resistance is reduced by 5 for 1 round. This reduction is not cumulative for multiple attacks within the same round, even if the target is struck by different weapons, each affected by a different casting of <i>splinter spell resistance</i>. However, the same creature&rsquo;s spell resistance can be reduced on multiple rounds by subsequent hits.

You point your finger at a creature, causing it to spontaneously burst into flame. The target takes 3d6 points of fire damage and catches on fire. A successful Fortitude save reduces this damage by half and prevents the target from catching on fire.

You cause a willing plant creature&rsquo;s body to sprout small, puffy mushrooms that remain for 1 round per caster level or until the creature uses them.

Those in the area must succeed at Fortitude saves or be sickened for 1d6 rounds as they are overcome by sneezing and coughing. The caster is immune to this poison effect, as are all creatures of the plant type.

You create a mobile area of bright light centered on one target while simultaneously suppressing other light sources surrounding it. The light level in the target&rsquo;s space increases to bright light, causing the target to take any penalties that it would normally take in bright light. In addition, all mundane light sources (and magic light sources of 3rd spell level or lower) within 20 feet of the target&rsquo;s space are suppressed, shedding no light as long as they remain within this spell&rsquo;s affected area and reverting the area normally affected by those light sources to their unmodified illumination levels.
</p>

<p>
The effects of spotlight are centered on the target and move as the target does. As a result, the target takes a &minus;20 penalty on all Stealth checks for the spell&rsquo;s duration and cannot benefit from concealment normally provided by darkness, as though illuminated with <i>faerie fire</i>.
</p>

<p>
If the target succeeds at its Reflex save, the spotlight is created in the target&rsquo;s square but does not move with the target, and it hinders the Stealth checks only of creatures within that square.

<p>
You cause a creature&rsquo;s arm to waver and prevent it from striking another creature. You can cast this spell when the target is about to make a melee attack against another creature. On a failed saving throw, the target does not follow through with its attack, and its entire action is wasted for the round. On a successful saving throw, the target can make its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion but losing both accuracy and power, taking a &minus;5 penalty on its attack and damage rolls. Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject to a &minus;2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it originally targeted for the duration of the spell.

A saddle affected by this spell becomes more comfortable to sit in, and the magic stabilizes any shaking motion caused by riding at a high speed. For the duration of the spell, the penalty to use ranged weapons while mounted in the target saddle decreases by 2. This stacks with the benefit of the Mounted Archery feat and similar effects. Furthermore, the DC for any concentration check required as a result of the mount&rsquo;s movement decreases by 2.

Often used by bards, spies, and arcane scholars to steal important texts without alerting their owners, <i>steal book</i> allows you to copy the contents of one book, folio, scroll, or other text to a blank one of sufficient size. In doing so, the original pages are wiped blank, though any covers or binding remain unchanged. Differences in size between the original and the blank folio don&rsquo;t matter, though the blank folio that the information is being transferred to must have an equal or greater amount of space (in number of pages or inches of scroll), or else any text that overflows the document is lost forever.
</p>

<p>
This spell cannot transfer magical writing (such as a wizard&rsquo;s spellbook or a magical scroll). At GM&rsquo;s discretion, the spell can restore lost information, such as a page obscured by spill wine, text erased by magic or mundane means, or even pages lost to fire or another type of damage.
</p>

<p>
When <i>steal book</i> is cast from a scroll, the beginning of the stolen text appears on the <i>steal book</i> scroll until you select a target book for the text to appear in. The stolen text glitters and sparkles while it remains on the scroll.

You temporarily drain youth and vitality from the target and channel it into yourself. If the target fails its Fortitude save, it physically ages 1d4 years per two caster levels (maximum 5d4), and you decrease your age by the same number of years. If this changes the age category of you or the target, only adjust physical ability scores. This effect cannot bring your age to lower than the minimum age of adulthood for your race. This stolen youth does not actually change your age or prolong your life; you will still die at your allotted time, no matter how youthful you appear. Likewise, the spell does not add to the target&rsquo;s true age, and cannot make the target die of old age.

The target exudes a strong odor that most predators recognize as the scent of helpless prey.

You increase the natural heat within your body, transferring it to your weapons and armor. As a swift action, you may grant one of your natural or manufactured weapons the <i>flaming</i> special ability for 1 round. If you have the fire subtype, your weapon instead gains the <i>flaming burst</i> special ability. If the weapon leaves your hand for any reason, it loses the <i>flaming</i> (or <i>flaming burst</i>) special ability until you spend a swift action to activate it again. You can only have <i>stoke the inner fire</i> active on one weapon at a time, and spending a swift action to imbue a second weapon with the spell&rsquo;s power immediately ends its effect on the first weapon.
</p>

<p>
The spell also builds a wall of searing heat between your armor and your flesh. Anyone striking you with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1 point of fire damage. A creature that grapples you or is grappled by you takes 1 point of fire damage each round the grapple persists. If you have the fire subtype, these damage values increase to 1d6 points of fire damage each. Removing your armor causes this wall of heat to dissipate and ends these effects.

Kreighton Shaine researched this spell from the fragmentary notes of a Vudrani ascetic recorded in a strange tome, and rumors credit him with no fewer than a dozen permanent <i>stolen light</i> gems hidden in compartments and drawers in his study. <i>Stolen light</i> stores images within a gem. To store an image, as part of casting you must touch a gem worth not less than 500 gp. You trap within the gem an image of everything visible within a 30-foot cone measured from the gem, in a direction of your choice. Alternatively, you can capture a less detailed image of a single object within sight.
</p>

<p>
Once the casting is complete, the gem turns opaque, and the image inside cannot be seen. The stolen image remains within the gem until released or dispelled.
</p>

<p>
To release an image, you touch a gem holding <i>stolen light</i> as a standard action and speak a command word chosen at the time of casting. For 1 minute per caster level, the image stored within the gem becomes visible. Details can be made out as clearly as they could be perceived at the time of casting. Darkvision is of no use for making out details in a stolen image, though low-light vision or other exceptional visual talents may reveal information the caster did not see.
</p>

<p>
Light sources brighter than bright light are reduced to bright light in the stolen image. Once the image has been released, it cannot again be recovered from the gem.
</p>

<p>
<i>Stolen light</i> can be made permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 10th level for a cost of 5,000 gp. This leaves the gem capable of projecting the image indefinitely, activated and deactivated by its command word, until it is destroyed or dispelled.

The subject can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than its own size. The range increment for this attack is 20 feet, and rocks can be hurled a maximum of 5 range increments. Damage is based on the size of the subject&mndash;1d8 points of damage for a Large creature, 1d6 for a Medium creature, or 1d4 for a Small creature&mdash;plus 1&ndash;&frac12; times the thrower&rsquo;s Strength bonus.

<p>
This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored. The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. For example, this spell would turn an animated stone statue into an animated flesh statue, but an ordinary statue would become a mass of inert flesh in the shape of the statue. You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.

You create floating swords of the type used as the material component for this spell (such as a rapier or scimitar) and magically propel them at your target. You can create one sword for every 2 caster levels that you possess, up to a maximum of five swords at 10th level. You must have line of effect between you and the target, and the target must be within the spell&rsquo;s range. You make a ranged attack roll for each sword (with no penalties for range increments or using melee weapons as ranged weapons); each attack has the same threat range and critical modifier and deals the same damage as a standard sword of the type expended. Swords created by this spell disappear after striking (or missing) their targets.

<p>
You step into any magical or naturally occurring storm and commune directly with the power of the wind and rain. This spell allows the storm&rsquo;s power to fill you, granting you knowledge and images of what else lies within its reach. As long as you remain within the storm, you can concentrate on it for 1 minute to determine whether or not other living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher are caught in the storm within 400 feet of you. Due to the nature of the spell, you do not need to attempt concentration checks against violent wind or storms when casting the spell, but other elements that might disrupt spellcasting require checks as normal. While the spell is in effect, you no longer need to attempt concentration checks as a result of wind or storms for spells you cast or concentrate on.
</p>

<p>
Once you&rsquo;ve sensed creatures with this spell by concentrating for 1 minute, you can continue concentrating to learn more. After you concentrate for 1 additional round, the spell reveals to you via winds and rain the presence of any Small or larger living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher within 400 feet of you. After 2 consecutive rounds of concentration, you learn the approximate distance to the detected life forms from your current location. After 3 rounds of concentration, the rain and winds allow you to determine the approximate direction of each life form. Once you&rsquo;ve concentrated in this way for 3 rounds, you gain a bonus equal to half your caster level on your next initiative check during the spell&rsquo;s duration.

<p>
You cause a straitjacket to spring into existence to restrain the target creature. You attempt a combat maneuver against the target&rsquo;s CMD. Your CMB for this check is equal to your caster level + 5 due to the straightjacket&rsquo;s Strength. This combat maneuver doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity, and if it succeeds, the target is restrained. This is similar to the grappled condition, except the target is able to move at its normal speed, the restraint doesn&rsquo;t cause the target to require concentration checks to use abilities that require concentration, and the target can&rsquo;t take actions that require one or more hands or arms to perform (including casting spells that require a somatic or material component).
</p>

<p>
Once it has been restrained for 1 round, the target can attempt an additional saving throw against a magical effect that makes it confused, a curse, a fear effect, or a madness. The caster chooses which effect the target gets an extra save against. This extra save applies to only effects with durations of 10 minutes per level or less, and it doesn&rsquo;t apply to instantaneous effects. This extra save occurs only once per casting of <i>straitjacket</i>.
</p>

<p>
A creature can attempt to escape the <i>straitjacket</i> with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, with a DC equal to 10 + your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest.

<p>
Your hair animates and extends to grapple and constrict an opponent. Make a grapple check against the target using your caster level as the base attack bonus plus a bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma bonus (if a sorcerer). This grapple check does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If your hair succeeds in grappling a foe, that creature takes 1d6 points of damage or your unarmed strike damage, whichever is greater, and gains the grappled condition. Your hair receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that your hair succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. The CMD of your hair, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.
</p>

<p>
Once you choose a target, your hair continues to attack that target independently of your own actions. You may designate a new target as a move action, which causes your hair to release its current target (if any) and attack the new target that round. Your hair cannot be targeted as a separate creature, but it can be dispelled.

You cause a large tree to grow in the 5-foot square you touch. The tree has 1 foot of thickness for every 4 caster levels you have, and it can grow to any height you designate, up to 5 feet high per caster level you have. If there is a ceiling or other barrier overhead, the maximum height of the tree cannot exceed the space available. At any point along the tree&rsquo;s height, you can create a sturdy wooden building that fills one 10-foot cube for every 4 caster levels you have. All portions of the structure must be adjacent to the trunk of the tree (or can have the tree trunk extend up through their spaces), but otherwise these cubes need not be contiguous. If you place the cubes so that they are contiguous, the buildings merge together, complete with ladders connecting different vertical levels. The fort is magically supported, but if the tree it is attached to is destroyed, the structure is destroyed as well (the tree has hardness 5 and 20 hp per caster level you have).
</p>

<p>
Each building you create has shuttered arrow slits on its walls and in the floor, granting those within the structure improved cover against attacks from outside while the arrow slits are open and total cover when they are closed. Each cube within the fort is equivalent to a <i><a href="#Secure Shelter">secure shelter</a></i>, other than the size and its wooded construction material (hardness 5). When you cast <i>sturdy tree fort</i>, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. Designated creatures gain a +10 bonus on Climb checks and are not denied their Dexterity bonuses while climbing on the fort&rsquo;s structure, as they find handholds and stable footholds easily on the tree and its buildings.
</p>

<p>
You cannot cast this spell in an area of worked stone, though you can cast it in natural surroundings that would not normally support the growth of a large tree, such as a cavern, desert, or glacier. If you cast this spell in a forest, jungle, or similar heavily treed terrain, the fort is camouflaged as long as its doors and windows remain closed (or even if they are open, as long as those within remain quiet and take no violent actions), requiring a successful DC 25 Perception check or Survival check to notice its presence.

Choose one object, creature, or force you can see within long range (400&rsquo; + 40&rsquo;/level). You alter your perceptions to become convinced the target is an illusion. For you, the target becomes transparent and does not create sound or smell. Until the spell ends, you can move through the target unimpeded and the target can move through you. The target&rsquo;s nonmagical attacks cannot harm you, and the target&rsquo;s magical attacks deal half damage to you. The target&rsquo;s non-damaging magical abilities have a 50% chance not to affect you, and you are immune to all its sonic, language-dependent, and scent-based attacks. However, your attacks deal no damage to the target, and your magical abilities do not affect the target at all. You or the target can affect each other normally through intermediaries. For instance, while the target would be immune to the direct effects of your <i>earthquake</i> spell, if the spell caused a room&rsquo;s ceiling to collapse, the target would not be immune to the effects of the collapse.

<p>
When this spell is cast upon a vessel, the ship is surrounded by a protective bubble of constantly replenishing, breathable air and sinks beneath the waves. For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull & Shackles Player&rsquo;s Guide for details). The ship&rsquo;s pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell&rsquo;s effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel&rsquo;s normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions.
</p>

<p>
The spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won&rsquo;t accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition. This spell has no effect if cast upon a ship in water that cannot cover the vessel entirely.
</p>

<p>
Although largely beneficial, this spell can be cast on a ship whose pilot does not want to submerge her vessel. The ship itself uses its Will saving throw to resist this effect.

This spell can affect any creatures with which you interacted in the last 24 hours. You alter the trails left by the chosen creatures, making it appear that another creature with which you are familiar left the trail instead (you must have met the creature with which you are familiar). If a tracker exceeds the DC of the skill check to follow the trail by an amount equal to your caster level, the tracker recognizes that the trail has been manipulated by this spell, although it cannot see the trail&rsquo;s true nature unless it uses magical means, such as <i>true seeing</i>.

<p>
This spell extracts the air from the target&rsquo;s lungs, causing swift suffocation. The target can attempt to resist this spell&rsquo;s effects with a Fortitude save&mdash;if he succeeds, he is merely staggered for 1 round as he gasps for breath. If the target fails, he immediately begins to suffocate. On the target&rsquo;s next turn, he falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the target drops to &minus;1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the target dies. Each round, the target can delay that round&rsquo;s effects from occurring by making a successful Fortitude save, but the spell continues for 3 rounds, and each time a target fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step further along the track to suffocation. This spell only affects living creatures that must breathe. It is impossible to defeat the effects of this spell by simply holding one&rsquo;s breath&mdash;if the victim fails the initial saving throw, the air in his lungs is extracted.

You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The <i>suggestion</i> must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.
</p>

<p>
The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.
</p>

<p>
A very reasonable <i>suggestion</i> causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as &minus;1 or &minus;2).

Accuser devils, known to diabolists as zebubs, are hideous flying creatures with the torso of a plump human infant and the body and wings of an enormous fly. They make excellent spies, for they have the ability to grant visions of what they have witnessed to others&mdash;the Queen&rsquo;s Hands sometimes use summoned zebubs to observe suspects from afar. Accuser devils are detailed in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i>.

Passengers inside are not harmed by the elemental, and can see, breathe, and act normally, suffering no environmental damage even when the elemental chariot is flying, underwater, burrowing, or using earth glide.

<i>Summon laborers</i> summons one humanoid petitioner per caster level. These petitioners hail from one plane of your choice and perform tasks at your direction. The petitioners cannot fight or travel to dangerous lands, but do assist your downtime activities within a settlement, increasing the effect of Influence or Labor you spend by 50%, to a maximum of 1 additional point of Influence or Labor for every 2 caster levels you possess. This stacks with any increase to the effect of Influence or Labor that you receive from your followers within the settlement where the downtime activity takes place (if any). <i>Summon laborers</i> is a spell of the same alignment type as the plane from which the summoned petitioners hail (chaotic and evil for the Abyss, lawful and good for Heaven, and so on). Effects that increase the number of creatures summoned by a spell (such as Superior Summoning) do not affect <i>summon laborers</i>.

<p>
This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st <b>Level</b> list on Table 10&ndash;1. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.
</p>

<p>
A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as <i>wish).</i>
</p>

<p>
When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10&ndash;1 marked with an &ldquo;*&rdquo; are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an &ldquo;*&rdquo; always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment.
</p>

<p>
Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell&rsquo;s type match your alignment.

<p>
This spell summons to your side a natural creature (typically an animal, fey, magical beast, outsider with the elemental subtype, or a giant). The summoned ally appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions as you command.
</p>

<p>
A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that have expensive material components (such as <i>wish</i>).
</p>

<p>
The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10&ndash;2. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.
</p>

<p>
When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. All creatures summoned with this spell without alignment subtypes have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell&rsquo;s type match your alignment.

When you cast this spell, you must hold out a miniature model of the ship you intend to create. The spell assembles a ship from raw materials conjured from other planes, taking a shape similar to the miniature ship in your hand. The miniature ship must be elaborately carved and worth 10% of the price of the type of ship it represents. The ship comes with all equipment necessary for sailing or rowing the ship but provides no crew or cargo. If you attempt to conjure the ship into a location where there isn&rsquo;t a sufficient amount of water to keep the ship afloat, the spell fails. The ship displaces all water and Medium or smaller aquatic animals within its space when it appears, but the location must be otherwise unoccupied at the time of casting the spell. You can cast this spell again to extend the duration of the conjured ship, replacing the remaining duration with the new spell&rsquo;s duration. When the spell&rsquo;s duration ends or the spell is dismissed, the ship instantly stops moving and then falls apart over the course of a minute.
</p>

The largest type of ship that you can summon depends on your caster level, as indicated by the table below.

You conjure a herd of aurochs or similar herd animal that immediately stampedes in the direction you indicate. The herd takes up a 20-foot-radius space and moves at a rate of 120 feet per round in a straight line. Any creatures caught in the herd&rsquo;s path take 4d6+9 points of damage that round as they are trampled beneath dozens of animals&rsquo; hooves. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
</p>

<p>
If the stampede&rsquo;s path would put it in an obviously dangerous area (such as over a cliff or through a fire) or force it to move through a solid barrier, the herd stops at the obstacle and moves in a new randomly determined direction until it reaches another obstacle or the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.

The Shoanti revere more than the deities of distant planes, but also the animals and natural forces of the rugged lands they call home. Shoanti spellcasters have learned ways to call upon the might of their quahs&rsquo; totem creatures in times of need. A character must have been raised by the Shoanti and be considered part of a quah to be able to cast this spell. Characters with access to this spell can only summon creatures revered by the quah they are a part of, as noted on the following lists.

Whenever the target&rsquo;s summoned creature is the target of a spell that deals damage, the target&rsquo;s summoner is also considered to be a target of that spell. Such a summoner gains his normal defenses against the spell, such as a saving throw and spell resistance, and cannot be affected if he is on another plane of existence.

The target weapon ignites into flame that does not hurt the weapon or the wielder, but damages those hit by the weapon.

For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action to evoke a dazzling beam of intense light each round. You can call forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th level). The spell ends when its duration runs out or your allotment of beams is exhausted.

You channel power into a melee weapon. If the weapon&rsquo;s wielder destroys an item with a successful sunder combat maneuver, she can release the extra power in the weapon, shattering the sundered item into jagged shards that deal 1d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to the creature that was wearing, carrying, or wielding the now-shattered item. Any creature (other than the wielder of the weapon targeted by this spell) adjacent to that creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 points of piercing and slashing damage from flying shards. The shards also count as whatever special materials the sundered item was made of (for example, the shards from a shattered cold iron weapon are cold iron). Once the weapon&rsquo;s extra power is unleashed, the spell is discharged.

You bolster the subject&rsquo;s sense of willpower and self-worth when you cast this spell. As you cast it, you must decide if you want to grant a bonus to saving throws against charms and compulsions or suppress charms and compulsions. If you grant a bonus to saving throws, you grant all affected creatures a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion effects for 10 minutes. If instead you suppress charms and compulsions, the spell&rsquo;s duration drops to concentration, to a maximum duration of 1 round per level. As long as you continue to concentrate, the spell suppresses all existing charm and compulsion effects affecting the targets, regardless of whether the effect is beneficial or harmful. New charm or compulsion effects that successfully target such a protected creature are automatically suppressed as long as you continue concentrating. If you cease concentrating, the spell effect immediately ends, and remaining charm or compulsion effects resume for the rest of their remaining durations as normal.

<p>
Nexian wizards first created this spell while researching the nature of the Mana Wastes, hoping to create small zones within the magic-starved region where their own spells could still function reliably. The best the Nexians could manage was this spell&mdash;a method to temporarily stabilize magic so that spellcasting within a small area can be accomplished without fear of triggering primal magic events. In the area of effect of this spell, primal magic events cannot be triggered.
</p>

<p>
The emanation grants a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against effects generated by primal magic outside of the spell&rsquo;s effect that expand into the area.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, suppressed primal magic tends to build up around the emanation created by this spell. When <i>suppress primal magic</i>&rsquo;s duration ends (or when the spell is dispelled), a primal magic event is immediately triggered at the center of the emanation if that point is still in an area where primal magic is active. The CR of this event is equal to the caster level of the recently ended <i>suppress primal magic</i> spell. The original caster of the <i>suppress primal magic</i> spell can attempt to negate this triggered primal magic event by making a DC 20 Will save&mdash;most spellcasters instead relocate to an area not affected by primal magic if they can so that they can end the spell&rsquo;s effect safely.

You infuse arcane power into the focus <i>ioun stone</i>, which must be currently floating around your head. If the <i>ioun stone</i> ever ceases floating around you, the spell ends immediately, and the spell fails if the <i>ioun stone</i> in question is cracked, burned, flawed, or otherwise of lesser value (such as a dull gray <i>ioun stone</i>). While the spell is active, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5 at caster level 20). Whenever you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or effect, you can burn out the focus, transforming it irrevocably into a dull gray <i>ioun stone</i> and ending this spell, but suppressing the mind-affecting effect for 1 round per 2,500 gp of value of the focus (minimum 1 round). Rounds during which the effect is suppressed still count against its duration, and the effect can still be dispelled or disrupted during this time.

This spell protects you (but not your gear) from a natural occurrence or condition (not against a spell or the action of a creature) that would kill you.

You instantly transport yourself and touched allies onto the nearest sky-facing surface directly above you. The destination surface may be solid ground or the surface of a body of water (or other liquid), depending on your position. If reaching the surface would require crossing planar boundaries or no sky-facing surface exists directly above your position, the spell fails and has no effect.
</p>

<p>
When the spell is cast, a magical beacon appears at both your departure and arrival points, suspended 3 feet in the air. These beacons are invisible to everyone but you and those allies touched when the spell was cast. You and every creature originally targeted by the spell can touch the beacon at your arrival point to teleport back to your original departure point. Each creature that chooses to return in this manner is transported to a free space adjacent to the beacon at your original departure point. If the area around the departure beacon is occupied by a solid body (for instance, rubble from a cave-in), then you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a solid surface within 100 feet of the beacon. If there is no free space within 100 feet, the spell effect ends with no return transportation.

The rulers of Azlant are thought to have used this spell to amplify the mythic power of themselves and their most gifted lieutenants. You amplify the mythic power of the target creatures, bolstering them with healing energy each time they draw upon their mythic abilities. When a creature affected by this spell expends uses of mythic power for any ability, it immediately heals 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). In addition, the creature benefits from one of the following additional effects.
<ul>
	<li>	Remove any one of the following conditions: dazzled, fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered.
	<li>	Reduce the dazed or stunned condition to staggered.
	<li>	Reduce the exhausted condition to fatigued.
	<li>	Reduce the frightened condition to shaken, or the panicked condition to frightened.
	<li>	Reduce the nauseated condition to sickened.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A target can benefit from the effects of <i>sustaining legend</i> only once per round, even if the target expends multiple uses of mythic power during that time.

A special gland grows on the inside of your throat, which absorbs any poisons that you ingest, and can be used to expel them in a toxic spray. Any time you consume ingested poison during the spell&rsquo;s duration, you can roll a caster level check against the poison&rsquo;s save DC in order to harmlessly absorb the poison, ignoring its effects. The spell can absorb up to 1 dose of poison per 3 caster levels, after which the gland is unable to process any more poison, and any further doses of ingested poison affect you normally.
</p>

<p>
You store each dose of absorbed poison within the gland, and you can end the spell to spray one dose of absorbed poison out of your mouth as a standard action. This sprays the poison in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save (at <i>swallow poison&rsquo;s</i> DC) or be exposed to the sprayed poison, which is treated as though it were a contact poison for this purpose. Everything about the poison other than its type, including its frequency, effect, and saving throw DC, are unaffected by this spell. Any other doses of poison you had absorbed instantly become inert when you end the spell. If the spell&rsquo;s duration ends without you spraying a poison, all poisons you had absorbed become inert.

You convert all of your soft tissue into swarms of insects or other creatures and send them off to do your bidding, leaving nothing but your bones and gear behind. These swarms have all their normal qualities and abilities but also bear a tiny portion of your consciousness that allows you to perceive what they do and to control their actions. While in this form, you cannot use any of your own abilities or take any actions other than controlling the swarms.
</p>

<p>
Each time you cast this spell you get a total allotment of levels equal to your caster level and any swarm you choose to create costs one or more of those levels.

Glands along your neck, back, or wrists swell and exude a viscous injury poison (<i>save</i> Fort DC 14; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 4 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Str; <i>cure</i> 1 save). You are not immune to this poison, and unless you have the poison use class feature or a similar ability, you are at risk of poisoning yourself. You can apply this poison to a weapon as a move action, and each dose you apply reduces the remaining duration of this spell by 1 minute. If doing so would reduce the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends, and any applied poisons retain their potency only until the end of your turn.

When you make an undulating gesture using your hand, the target item changes slightly in shape and appearance to resemble a cross between its original form and that of a venomous animal. For example, a staff might change to resemble a snake, a shield might change to resemble an enormous venomous beetle, or the hilt of a sword might change to resemble a scorpion&rsquo;s tail.

If this spell is cast on a held item, the wielder adds his Will save bonus to the saving throw. You must be able to see the item to cast this spell on it.
</p>

<p>
The item retains all its properties, but whenever a creature picks up, attacks with, activates, or otherwise manipulates the item (with the exception of dropping the item) after this spell is cast, it animates and bites the creature. The attack is resolved before the action that triggered it. This spell otherwise does not affect the creature&rsquo;s ability to use the item.
</p>

<p>
If the item is a nonmagical weapon, it has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your spellcasting ability score modifier, and its attack deals 1d4 points of piercing damage. If the target item is a magic weapon, it retains any magical qualities, and its enhancement bonus is still added to both the attack roll and the damage roll.
</p>

<p>
A creature that takes damage from the bite is affected as if by a venomous snake&rsquo;s poison (<i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Con; <i>cure</i> 1 save). The poison&rsquo;s save DC is equal to this spell&rsquo;s DC.

When this spell is cast on a natural, unworked surface, it creates an extradimensional underground space large enough to comfortably hold two creatures of any size per caster level (maximum 12). The room is sealed by a 5-foot-square camouflaged trap door that can be locked from within. (This trap door has hardness 10 and 20 hit points per caster level; the Perception DC to see the hidden trap door equals the spell&rsquo;s save DC.) The door and room are made of the same material of the material component used to cast the spell. You can choose the shape and configuration of the room when you create it; however, any furnishings (tables, beds, etc.) in the room are made of the same material as the room and cannot be moved once created.

When triggered, a <i>symbol of death</i> kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the <i>symbol</i> (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death</i> affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points&rsquo; worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death</i> is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.
</p>

<p>
Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death</i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death</i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death</i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death</i> works normally.
</p>

<p>
As a default, a <i>symbol of death</i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a <i>symbol of death</i> can&rsquo;t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>&rsquo;s triggering conditions cannot be changed.
</p>

<p>
In this case, &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death</i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the <i>symbol</i> reacts to touch. You can&rsquo;t use a <i>symbol of death</i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered <i>symbol of death</i> remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death</i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
</p>

<p>
You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death</i> can be based on a creature&rsquo;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don&rsquo;t qualify.
</p>

<p>
When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the <i>symbol</i>&rsquo;s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune&rsquo;s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.
</p>

<p>
You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death</i>, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol</i> with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the <i>symbol</i>&rsquo;s spell level). Of course, if the <i>symbol</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the <i>symbol</i>.
</p>

<p>
A <i>symbol of death</i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death</i>. Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death</i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Symbol of <i>death</i></i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.
</p>

<p>
A permanent <i>symbol of death</i> that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol of death</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <i>symbol of death</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of death</i>.

You conjure a sizable symbol into being, a rune suggestive of bloated bodies, flung food, and flowing wine. This spell functions as <i><a href="#Symbol of Death">symbol of death</a></i>, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the <i>symbol of debauchery</i> are instead filled with lust for the nearest conscious creature. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level, even after creatures leave the symbol&rsquo;s area of effect. Affected creatures are compelled to rush to the nearest creature in order to caress and kiss it, and may take no other actions. Each creature receives a single Will save when the <i>symbol of debauchery</i> is triggered to negate the effect. If no other creatures are visible, an affected creature may act normally.

This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the <i>symbol</i> immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a <i><a href="#Wall of Force">wall of force</a></i>. Destroying the <i>symbol</i> ends the effect, though destroying it once the <i>symbol</i> has been activated requires destroying the <i>wall of force</i> first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.
</p>

<p>
When scribing a <i>symbol of sealing</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of sealing</i>, but doing this extends the casting time as described under <i><a href="#Symbol of Death">symbol of death</a></i>. However, the force wall created by the <i>symbol</i> blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned&mdash;the password only prevents them from triggering the <i>symbol</i>, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.
</p>

<p>
A <i>disintegrate</i> spell or similar effect can destroy the <i>wall of force</i> created by the <i>symbol</i> if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A <i>knock</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of sealing</i> or its force wall. A <i>symbol of sealing</i> cannot be dispelled, but <i>mage&rsquo;s disjunction</i> automatically destroys it.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Symbol of Death">symbol of death</a></i>, except that using the material component, you scribe a <i>symbol of striking</i> so it fills a 5-foot square. Once triggered, the <i>symbol of striking</i> glows and lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has made a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever comes first. When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence modifier (magus, witch, wizard) or Wisdom modifier (cleric) or Charisma modifier (oracle, sorcerer) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version of you wielding the material component appears to make these attacks.
</p>

<p>
The symbol attacks any non-attuned creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from the symbol. However, when the symbol first attacks a creature, the symbol must overcome that creature&rsquo;s spell resistance or be rendered unable to harm it. The symbol never again attacks such creatures. Further, when the symbol first attacks a creature, a successful Will saving throw allows the creature to see the shadow nature of the attacks and take half damage when such attacks hit.

<i>Symbol of striking</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.

<p>
By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure, you can create a damaging vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10 points of damage per round to the target structure, bypassing hardness. You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round per level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding, the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs.

<i>Sympathetic vibration</i> cannot affect creatures (including constructs). Since a structure is an unattended object, it gets no saving throw to resist the effect.

</p>

<p>
Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 &times; 10 minutes later.

<p>
You scramble the synaptic connections of your target, causing it to lose the ability to coherently communicate and to take unintended actions when it meant to perform others. The target cannot effectively communicate while under the spell&rsquo;s influence, and thus cannot engage in acts like speaking, attempting Bluff checks to pass secret messages, writing, or using telepathy, although the spell doesn&rsquo;t prevent verbalizations made for purposes other than communication, such as command words or the verbal component of spellcasting.
</p>

<p>
The target&rsquo;s mind is too scrambled to take full-round actions or longer actions, as the target&rsquo;s attention inevitably wanders before the action completes. Whenever the target attempts to take a move action or a standard action, roll on the following table instead. If the result on the table is an action that the target cannot take, the target takes no action instead.

You overstimulate the senses of the affected creature, causing its senses to interfere with another. While a creature is under the effects of this spell, sensory input is processed by the wrong senses, such that noise triggers bursts of colors, smells create sounds, and so on. The affected creature moves at half speed, has a 20% miss chance on attacks, and takes a &minus;4 penalty to AC and on skill checks and Reflex saves. Successful spellcasting while affected requires a concentration check with a DC equal to this spell&rsquo;s save DC plus the level of spell being cast.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the affected creature is considered distracted for the purpose of attempting Perception checks. Effects that negate or reduce concealment do not affect the miss chance from <i>synesthesia</i>.

This spell was developed by an Aldori Academy student after several weeks of observing (and occasionally joining) Restov barroom brawls. You draw on your mind&rsquo;s hidden reserves, instantaneously mastering advanced combat techniques. When you cast this spell, choose a combat feat. You must meet all prerequisites for this feat, treating your magus level as your base attack bonus for this purpose. For the duration of this spell, you are treated as if you had the chosen feat. Once you cast this spell, you cannot change the chosen feat (or any decisions related to that feat) for additional castings of this spell on the same day. A creature can benefit from only one <i>tactical adaptation</i> spell at a time.

This spell increases the effectiveness of a group&rsquo;s formation in battle. When cast, all creatures under the effect of the spell must be adjacent to one another, forming an unbroken chain of squares (which may include creatures sharing the same square). This chain does not need to be a straight line. Each target in the chain receives a +2 defection bonus to AC as long as the targets stay adjacent to at least one other creature affected by the spell; moving more than 5 feet from another target ends the spell with respect to that creature only. For example, a cleric could cast it on himself and four dwarves blocking a 20-foot-wide corridor; the cleric can move freely from the left side of the formation to the right side (whether in front of or behind the other targets) and not break the spell as long as he stays within 5 feet of at least one of them.

You grow a draconic tail (clothing and armor adjust as necessary), or if you already have a tail, it takes on a draconic appearance. If you have a draconic bloodline, the tail matches the appearance of that dragon type; otherwise, it matches the appearance of a dragon type whose alignment matches your own. You gain a tail slam attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if Small, 1d8 if Large) + your Strength modifier. If you already have a tail attack, you instead extend the reach of your tail attack by 5 feet. If you have a tail sweep attack, this spell increases its radius by 10 feet.
</p>

<p>
If used as part of a full-attack action, the tail slam is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus &minus; 5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage. You can end this spell before its normal duration by uttering a bestial roar as a swift action. When you do, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the roar.

You compel the wind to push the targets in a direction of your choice. The subjects can hustle during local and overland movement without risk of fatigue. If the subjects are flying, the first 20 feet of movement each round in the chosen direction does not count against their movement for the round. Each creature remains affected only while within 120 feet of every other subject. You can change the tailwind&rsquo;s direction once per hour by concentrating as a standard action.

A 15-foot-long whip of sonic energy springs from your hand, delivering a loud crack when you strike with it. The <i>tamer&rsquo;s lash</i> acts as a whip that deals 1d4 points of sonic damage on a hit, but it has no physical substance and you cannot use it to perform combat maneuvers, nor can it be sundered or disarmed. If you strike an animal with the <i>tamer&rsquo;s lash</i>, the animal must succeed at a Will saving throw or be unable to attack you for 1d3 rounds. Furthermore, if the whipped animal starts its turn unable to attack you as a result of this spell and it is within 30 feet of you, it must spend its first action moving away from you, if it is able. Combattrained animals, animal companions, and animals with Hit Dice in excess of your caster level + 4 gain a +4 circumstance bonus on their saves to avoid being intimidated in this way.

You create a sticky ball of burning tar that you can hurl at your enemies as a ranged attack. If the tar ball strikes, it deals 1d4 points of fire damage + your Strength modifier, and splashes the target with hot, sticky tar. The tar deals 1d4 points of fire damage each round on the creature&rsquo;s turn for the next 1d4 rounds and gives the target a &minus;2 penalty to Dexterity for that duration. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish or cool the tar before taking this additional damage.
</p>

<p>
Extinguishing or cooling the tar requires a DC 15 Reflex save or at least 1 gallon of nonflammable liquid. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically cooling the target automatically ends the effect.

You convert a layer of the ground to hot tar. Creatures in the area when the tar appears take 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum of 10d6) and must succeed at a Reflex save or become entangled. An entangled creature receives a saving throw each round to free itself from the tar, and can also attempt to free itself by spending a move action to attempt a Strength check or Escape Artist check (DC = spell saving throw DC).
</p>

<p>
It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square in the area of effect, and the DC of Acrobatics checks within the area of effect increases by 5. The area is difficult terrain. A creature that moves into or starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must reattempt this Reflex save or become entangled. A creature that falls prone in the area takes a &minus;4 penalty on its Reflex save against the tar and on Strength and Escape Artist checks to escape the tar.
</p>

<p>
A creature that escapes the tar still takes fire damage from the tar until the spell ends or that creature spends a full-round action removing the tar. A creature with tar on it takes a &minus;4 penalty on Acrobatics and Fly checks made to fly with wings or similar appendages.

Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract&rsquo;s duration.

Legend claims runelords used this spell to literally benefit from drinking the tears of their captured foes. This spell turns nonmagic liquids&mdash;including spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated drinks, tears, seawater, and similar fluids&mdash;into mead or wine of average quality. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage.

Creatures that drink the mead or wine created by this spell become sharp-witted and clear-minded, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus on all Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks. This increases to a +5 bonus at caster level 9th, and to +10 (the maximum) at caster level 15th.

You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.

	<th>	Sustained Force:

<p>
This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.
</p>

<p>
An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.

Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.
</p>

<p>
If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).

You telekinetically launch an ally across the battlefield to anywhere within this spell&rsquo;s range. While moving, your ally is flying just above the ground unless you wish otherwise. Movement from this spell provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, although you can lift your ally over objects or out of enemy reach, as long as your ally remains within this spell&rsquo;s range. If your ally lands adjacent to an opponent, he can spend an immediate action to make a melee attack against that opponent with a +2 bonus on the attack roll.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Resilient Sphere">resilient sphere</a></i>, but the creatures or objects caught inside the globe created by the spell are made nearly weightless. Anything contained within a <i>telekinetic sphere</i> weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents.
</p>

<p>
You can move the sphere, along with the objects and creatures it contains that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less, by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface. You can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell&rsquo;s duration.
</p>

<p>
The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.
</p>

You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.

You generate a storm of telekinetic energy that emanates from you, ripping through the spell&rsquo;s area of effect with devastating force. Any creature caught in the spell&rsquo;s radius takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and is dazed and stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the dazed and stunned effects.

<p>
The <i>telekinetic storm</i> damages objects in the area.

The touched items levitate in your space. When you cast the spell and once per round thereafter, you can launch one item at a target of your choice as a standard action. The ranged attack is made as if you had thrown the item unless it&rsquo;s ammunition for a weapon, in which case the attack is made as if fired from a heavy crossbow (if a bolt), a halfling sling staff (if a sling bullet), a blowgun (if a blowgun dart), a composite longbow with a +2 Strength rating (if an arrow), an atlatl (if an atlatl dart), or a pistol (if a firearm bullet). A firearm pellet launched by the spell functions as a shuriken.
</p>

<p>
When you launch ammunition with this spell, you don&rsquo;t take a penalty on your attack rolls for lacking proficiency with the ammunition&rsquo;s weapon; you do, however, take the usual &minus;4 penalty for throwing an improvised weapon if you launch an item not intended to be used as a weapon. The attack roll uses your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher) in place of your Dexterity modifier. Range increment and proficiency penalties apply as normal. The attack has an effective Strength bonus, if applicable, equal to the higher of your Intelligence and Charisma modifiers. The spell is discharged when all touched items have been launched.

You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.

This spell creates an invisible psychic interference that inhibits telepathic communication. When cast upon a creature that can communicate via telepathy, this spell prevents that ability&rsquo;s use&mdash;either to receive or project thoughts. When cast upon a creature without telepathy, the spell merely prevents the target from receiving telepathic communication. Those affected by this spell or that attempt to telepathically communicate with creatures under its effects are not innately aware that their communication is being inhibited. This spell temporarily disrupts spells and effects like <i>telepathic bond</i> or telepathic messages sent by a <i>helm of telepathy</i>, but not attacks and effects unrelated to communication like <i>detect thoughts</i> or a neothelid&rsquo;s psychic crush.

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.
</p>

<p>
You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.
</p>

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;False destination&rdquo; is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you.

You instantly teleport a building in a settlement you control to another lot or series of lots in the same settlement district. The building to be teleported must be unoccupied, and the area to which you wish to move the building must be cleared and unoccupied during the casting of this spell. A building cannot be teleported to an area it would not normally be able to occupy, such as an area adjacent to a prohibited building type. If you don&rsquo;t wholly own the structure, all of the structure&rsquo;s owners must consent to the structure&rsquo;s teleportation before the spell is cast; otherwise, it fails immediately.
</p>

<p>
This spell only functions on buildings that occupy a number of lots equal to one-fourth your caster level (so, for instance, a 16th-level caster could use this spell on a building that occupies up to 4 lots).

<i>Teleport trap</i> wards an area, redirecting all teleportation into or out of the area to a specific point within the area determined by you at the time of casting. The destination must be an open space on a solid surface. The spell&rsquo;s area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or through similar means). A teleporting creature that is affected by a <i>teleport trap</i> can resist the effect with a Will save&mdash;if the save is successful, the creature simply doesn&rsquo;t teleport at all (but the use of the teleport effect is still consumed)&mdash;either to the intended location or the <i>teleport trap</i>&rsquo;s actual destination. A DC 27 Knowledge (arcana) allows such a creature to recognize the <i>teleport trap</i>&rsquo;s presence, but does not reveal the trap&rsquo;s linked destination.
</p>

<p>
At your discretion, the <i>teleport trap</i> can exclude a category of creatures, such as an alignment, a type of creature, or creatures that carry a specific item or know a password (though this only works if the creature is teleporting out of the area, not into it). You select this option and the conditions at the time you cast the spell. Overly complicated conditions may cause the spell to fail entirely. Multiple castings of <i>teleport trap</i> can be linked to cover a larger area, allowing teleported creatures to be directed to a single point within the combined area of the spells.
</p>

<p>
<i>Teleport trap</i> can be made permanent at the cost of 7,000 gp. A single <i>permanency</i> spell can be used on all <i>teleport traps</i> that share a linked destination, but the gold piece cost must be paid for each individual spell.
</p>

<p>
The Pathfinders of the Grand Lodge make use of permanent <i>teleport traps</i> in several key locations, trapping would-be intruders in a small wing of jail cells. At least one crypt of the Whispering Tyrant makes use of the spell as well, trapping grave robbers in coffin-sized stone cysts, there to die a slow and agonizing death from thirst and starvation.

This spell functions like <i><a href="#Teleport">teleport</a></i>, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.

<p>
You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as <i><a href="#Greater Teleport">greater teleport</a></i>, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can&rsquo;t change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.
</p>

<p>
The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.
</p>

<p>
<i>Teleportation circle</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>teleportation circle</i> that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.
</p>

<p>
Magic traps such as <i>teleportation circle</i> are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use the Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of <i>teleportation circle</i>.

<p>
This spell allows you to witness two divergent decisions and choose which to pursue. Upon completing this spell, you must immediately choose two other different spells that you could cast at that moment and that each have a casting time of 1 standard action; these spells take effect simultaneously, and you must track all resulting effects, areas of effect, saving throws, and other outcomes separately as if each had been cast normally and the other spell had never happened. Once you&rsquo;ve seen how each spell resolves, you must choose which version of reality occurred, expending the standard action, prepared spell, and material components as necessary. The other spell&rsquo;s results are ignored and do not require an action or expend the prepared spell, spell slot, or material components. If the targets of the spell you did not choose expended any resources or effects to resist your spell, those resources or effects are also not expended. If you cast this spell and do not or cannot immediately follow the instructions described above, this spell has no effect.
</p>

<p>
For example, after casting this spell, a wizard could cast <i>temporal stasis</i> on a demon and <i>fireball</i> on a group of orcs. Seeing that the demon succeeds at its saving throw against <i>temporal stasis</i> and that the <i>fireball</i> kills many orcs, the wizard chooses the <i>fireball</i> to take effect. The <i>temporal stasis</i> is treated as if it had not been cast, and its spell slot and costly material component are not expended.
</p>

<p>
Casting this spell more than once in a single day is risky. On the second and subsequent casting in a 24-hour period, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or be exposed to a crippling array of possibilities and paradoxes that leave you confused for 24 hours. Whenever this confusion would cause you to attack the nearest creature, you instead expend your highest-level remaining prepared spell or spell slot, if any, with no effect.

<p>
When you complete this spell, note your current location and condition, including your hit point total and any ongoing conditions affecting you as well as their durations (e.g. poison, sickened, ability damage, and spell effects). This spell creates a beacon in space-time that&rsquo;s imperceptible to anyone but you. As a standard action while you are within range of the beacon before the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, you can discharge the spell to transport yourself back to the marked location and restore yourself to the condition you were in when you cast the spell; this does not restore any expended items, charges, or spells you may have used during that time. This does not reverse effects for anyone else, and to bystanders it appears as though you teleported to the beacon location and regained conditions you had when the beacon was set. <i>Temporal regression</i> strains your body; when the spell is discharged, you gain 1 temporary negative level for every 2 rounds that passed since you cast the spell. These negative levels disappear after 24 hours.
</p>

<p>
You can discharge the spell to transport yourself back to your beacon as an immediate action instead of a standard action, but doing so utterly and entirely consumes the spell&rsquo;s focus.

You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead (such as with <i>raise dead</i>). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric can cast <i>raise dead</i> or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with <i>temporary resurrection</i>, this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.

<p>
With a gentle caress, you infuse the creature touched with a blight of energy from the Abyss that feeds upon goodness and transforms flesh into monstrous deformity. The target can resist a <i>teratoid caress</i> with a successful Fortitude save, but even on a successful save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round by the vile energies.
</p>

<p>
If the target fails the save, his body becomes infected with Abyssal energy and a small portion of his body distorts and grows hideous, inflicting 2 points of Dexterity damage or 2 points of Charisma damage (50% chance of either effect). This deformity is always unsightly and offensive. Thereafter, the victim suffers a &minus;1 penalty on all saving throws against evil effects. Worse, whenever the victim casts a good spell, channels positive energy, or offers a prayer to a good-aligned deity, the Abyssal energies seethe inside him, forcing a new Fortitude save to resist suffering an additional 1 point of Dexterity or Charisma damage. A good-aligned divine spellcaster who suffers from this curse suffers a &minus;4 penalty on all concentration checks. This is a curse effect, but the effect can also be instantly removed with a <i>dispel evil</i> or <i>atonement</i> spell.

<p>
You alter the area&rsquo;s terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area&rsquo;s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn&rsquo;t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn&rsquo;t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.
</p>

<p>
You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.
</p>

<p>
Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.
</p>

<p>
This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.
</p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.

<p>
You instill a target with the fear that the nearest other intelligent creature knows her darkest secret. If she is in the midst of another situation as vital as protecting her darkest secret, such as combat, this doesn&rsquo;t cause her to cease participating, but otherwise, she becomes compelled to use her abilities and skills to determine exactly how much the other individual knows. Even if she isn&rsquo;t around other creatures or otherwise avoids confronting her paranoia for a time, the nagging fear causes the target to become shaken for the duration of the spell (though this doesn&rsquo;t stack with other fear effects to make the target frightened or panicked).
</p>

<p>
The subject&rsquo;s paranoia increases over time, forcing her to take additional steps to protect herself from the other creature. Depending on her personality (or subject to the GM&rsquo;s discretion), she might confess, publicly demand to know what the other creature knows, attack the other creature to silence it, or offer the other creature a bribe.

A wooden thorn the size of a javelin (appropriate for your size) appears in your open hand. You can wield this thorn as a javelin, and you are proficient in its use. Any creature struck by the javelin must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. If you throw the javelin, another one appears in your hand. Any javelin that leaves your grasp disappears at the end of your turn. Each javelin attack you make reduces the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration by 1 minute.
</p>

<p>
If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after that attack resolves.

This spell functions just like the spell <i><a href="#Snare">snare</a></i> but those caught in it take 1 point of damage per round, as the thorn-covered vine slowly cuts into them. In addition, any attempt to escape or destroy the snare deals 1d6 points of damage to the trapped creature.

A thorn snare can only be found with a DC 24 Search check. A trapped creature can escape by making a DC 24 Escape Artist check or a DC 24 Strength check as a full-round action.

Any creature that moves within 15 feet of the spell&rsquo;s area is attacked once on its turn by the animated plants. The plants use your caster level as their base attack bonus and add your spellability score modifier (Intelligence for witches; Wisdom for druids, rangers, and shamans) to the attack roll. A volley of thorns counts as a thrown weapon and deals 2d6 points of piercing damage on a successful hit. A creature that enters the spell&rsquo;s area or ends its turn there automatically takes 2d6 points of piercing damage.

When you cast this spell, you establish a mental echo of up to 25 words. Any attempt to read the surface thoughts of the target creature reads only this mental echo unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + your caster level). If you cast <i>thought echo</i> on yourself, the DC is instead equal to 15 + your caster level. In addition, when casting this spell upon yourself, you can change the echoed thoughts by taking a standard action and concentrating.

<i>Threefold aspect</i> allows you to shift your appearance between your natural age and three idealized age categories: young adult (youth/maiden), adulthood (father/mother), or elderly (elder/crone). In each case, your appearance is your own at the appropriate age, rather than that of a new individual.
</p>

<p>
You may change between these three aspects or your actual age as a standard action. As the young adult, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, but suffer a &minus;2 penalty to Wisdom. In the adult aspect, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a &minus;2 penalty to Dexterity. As the elderly aspect, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a &minus;2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. As enhancement bonuses, these stack with any bonuses or penalties you may have from your actual age (which are untyped bonuses)&mdash;the bonuses granted by this spell represent your idealized form in this threefold aspect rather than simply duplicating your ability scores at any one particular age.
</p>

<p>
<i>True seeing</i> reveals your natural appearance overlaid with that your aspect, recognizing both as part of your true self.

You grow two additional faces set equidistantly around your head, each embodying a different aspect of your personality that you choose (such as kindliness, joy, or wrath). You gain all-around vision and can&rsquo;t be flanked. Effects that would blind you, deafen you, block your mouth, or otherwise affect your face, including beneficial effects that grant you exceptional vision, only affect a single face (for example, it would take three castings of <i>blindness/ deafness</i> to blind you). You lose all-around vision if even a single face becomes blind. This spell doesn&rsquo;t grant you additional magic item slots or additional heads. When <i>threefold face</i> ends, you gain all the conditions from all three faces, for good or ill.

You view several possible futures at once, allowing you to thread a needle around disasters by taking a middle path.

You stomp your foot or strike your weapon against the ground or floor, creating a ripple of power that you can use to trip a creature. Attempt the combat maneuver check to trip the target, but instead of your base attack bonus you can use your caster level, and instead of your Strength modifier you can use your spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for magi and wizards; Wisdom for druids and rangers; Charisma for bloodragers and sorcerers).

If you cast <i>tidal surge</i> on land, you create an onrushing surge of water 10 feet high in a 30-foot cone that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level) and extinguishes all nonmagical fires in the area. Magical fire effects in the area of a <i>tidal surge</i> are affected as if you had cast <i>dispel magic</i>. In addition to taking damage, creatures that fail their Reflex saves are pushed 1d4&times;5 feet away from you, and Medium or smaller creatures are also knocked prone.
</p>

<p>
If you cast this spell in or on a body of water at least 30 feet across, you can shape the spell either as the cone described above or as a 60-foot line. In either shape, the water deals 1d10 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have in addition to pushing away creatures that fail their Reflex saves.

With a lascivious wink and a sensuous sway, you flood a foe&rsquo;s mind with lustful thoughts of you, distracting your target and rendering that creature vulnerable to your attacks. An affected creature takes a penalty equal to half your caster level on concentration checks and to its CMD against dirty trick, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers you perform. The creature is also denied its Dexterity bonus to AC for the first melee attack you make against it each round. If the target would not normally be sexually attracted to you, it receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw. If you end your turn more than 20 feet from the target or end your turn where your target cannot see you, this spell immediately ends.

This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the <i>time stop</i> is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the <i>time stop</i> have their normal effects on other creatures once the <i>time stop</i> ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.

A word of arcane-empowered inspiration can snatch victory from seeming defeat. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill check. The target gains a +1 competence bonus per five caster levels (maximum +3 bonus) on the attack roll or skill check retroactively.

You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
</p>

<p>
The temperature inside the hut is 70 F if the exterior temperature is between 0 and 100 F. An exterior temperature below 0 or above 100 lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
</p>

<p>
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

A shimmering torrent of raw elemental power springs into existence, originating from your outstretched palms. The blast resembles a horizontal whirlwind of howling winds, searing flame, and tumbling shrapnel of ice and metal. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Reflex save or take 8d6 points of damage from a variety of effects&mdash;2d6 points of fire damage, 2d6 points of cold damage, 2d6 points of sonic damage, and 2d6 points of slashing damage that overcomes adamantine damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
The elemental line is an ongoing effect that persists for as long as you remain concentrating on it, up to 1 round for every three levels you possess (maximum 6 rounds). The line affects any creatures that pass through it on their turn, requiring them to make Reflex saves or take damage as noted.
</p>

<p>
On your turn you may shift the line&rsquo;s position as you please. Moving the line does not cause it to sweep through intermediary squares but only affects creatures in its new area of effect.

You must hold an elixir, infused extract, poison, or potion in hand as you cast this spell. The held substance drains from its container into a magical sac in your body. While the spell lasts, you can deliver the substance with a mere touch. To do so to an opponent, you must make a successful melee touch attack. If you hit, the substance takes effect immediately, despite any onset period, and that opponent receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the substance. In the case of a personal infused extract, the opponent receives both a Fortitude save and spell resistance. If you miss, the substance remains in the magical sac for you to use later.
</p>

<p>
This spell protects you from poison in the sac, but unless you have the poison use class feature, you suffer a 5% chance of exposing yourself to the poison when you first cast the spell. If you roll a natural 1 while attempting to inject the poison into an enemy, you are exposed to it.

You create a coating of slime on your hand. When you make a successful melee touch attack with the slime, it pulls free of you and sticks to the target, at which point it acts like green slime, dealing 1d3 points of Constitution damage per round. Anything that destroys green slime (scraping, freezing, burning, cutting, sunlight, or <i>remove disease</i>) destroys this slime. If the slime kills a creature, it consumes the body and then dies. It cannot transfer to a creature other than the original target, and dies if separated from the original target.

<p>
This spell functions only against a creature with an attitude toward you of indifferent or better, and only if the target is not hostile toward you or your visible allies. A target touched by you (this touch usually requires a successful melee touch attack) must succeed at a Will saving throw or fall asleep for 2d6 hours. While asleep, the creature is helpless. For 1 minute after the creature is affected, any loud noise or rough contact causes it to awaken immediately. Thereafter, slapping or wounding an affected creature awakens it, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (this is an application of the aid another action).

You cause webs to grow between the target&rsquo;s fingers and its feet to transform into flippers, granting a swim speed of 30 feet along with the standard +8 bonus on Swim checks and the ability to take 10 even if distracted or endangered. You can also use the run action while swimming, provided you swim in a straight line. This transformation causes any boots or gloves the target is wearing to meld into its form (although magic items with a continuous effect continue to function). This spell does not grant the target any ability to breathe water.

The target creature&rsquo;s blood becomes poisonous. Anytime the target takes piercing or slashing damage, a spray of acidic blood spurts from its body in the direction of the opponent who inflicted the wound. This blood travels in a 10-foot line, striking the first creature or object it touches. A creature struck by the blood is exposed to black adder venom and must save against the poison as normal, with a DC equal to the spell&rsquo;s DC.

With a squeezing hand gesture, you cause internal bleeding in the target creature&rsquo;s venom glands or similar organs. The target must attempt a saving throw against its own poison using the DC for this spell. If it fails, the creature is poisoned and suffers the full effect of its poison. Any subsequent saving throws that the target must attempt against the poison use the normal DC for the poison rather than this spell&rsquo;s DC.

You immediately become aware of any teleportation effects that begin or end within the spell&rsquo;s area. The spell&rsquo;s area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the exact origin point of any teleportation effect that originates within the spell&rsquo;s area, and the exact end point of any teleportation effect that terminates within the spell&rsquo;s area. Further, you can detect the lingering traces of any teleportation effect that occurred up to 1 hour previously, in the same fashion. You intuitively know, to the nearest minute, when the teleportation effect occurred.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you detect the origin point or termination point of any teleportation effect with this spell, you can study that origin point or termination point for 1 round. If you do, you can attempt a caster level check (DC = 11 + the teleportation effect&rsquo;s caster level), taking a &minus;5 penalty if the effect occurred more than 1 minute ago. If you succeed, you gain a glimpse of the teleportation effect&rsquo;s termination point (if you detected an origin point) or origin point (if you detected a termination point). This glimpse lasts long enough for you to get a brief look at the area, but not long enough to scrutinize it in detail. It doesn&rsquo;t come with any geographic knowledge of the location, so it is not sufficient for <i>teleport</i> or similar magic. You can&rsquo;t retry the caster level check, even if you cast <i>trace teleport</i> again.

This spell creates an illusory trail in the form of a misty and visible scent coming from the rose used as this spell&rsquo;s material component. When you cast this spell, the scent of the rose leaves a faint pink-tinged illusion that ripples and flows in the area. Only you and up to six creatures you designate upon casting the spell can see the illusion. To designate a creature, you must know it well. It is not enough simply to have met that creature once or heard of the creature.
</p>

<p>
When you move, this illusory scent leaves a trail, though there are no telltale signs of which direction you moved if creatures designated by this spell find a middle section of the trail. This is typically used to create backtracking method for the caster&rsquo;s handpicked allies, useful for navigating in and out of mazes or labyrinthine cave complexes without leaving behind an obvious trail.

A target that isn&rsquo;t willing to have his tattoo removed or to receive the transferred tattoo can resist this spell with a Fortitude save&mdash;if successful, the transfer fails and the caster of this spell is staggered for 1 round by the backlash of magical energy. A tattoo can be transferred from a dead creature in this manner to a living host, provided the body has been dead no longer than one hour per caster level.

You create an alchemical residue on your hands that gradually converts a touched, unattended, nonmagical object into iron, paper, or wood (your choice). The spell converts at most 1 cubic foot of material per caster level you have; if the object is larger than the maximum volume, the transfiguration stops once that amount of matter has been converted. If your caster level is at least 14th, you can opt to create lead. If your caster level is at least 19th, you can opt to create precious metals. If you create a precious metal, you must use an equivalent value of alchemical reagents as a material component (5 sp per pound of copper, 5 gp per pound of silver, 50 gp per pound of gold, 500 gp per pound of platinum).

You transmute blood in the target&rsquo;s body to acid, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage/2 levels (maximum 12d6) each round.

The creature is staggered and sickened by the debilitating pain. A successful Fortitude save each round halves the damage and negates the staggered condition for 1 round. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it dissolves, leaving only the barest trace of remains. A dissolved creature&rsquo;s equipment is unaffected.

Anyone who strikes the target with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6 points of acid damage as the acidic blood sprays on the attacker. If the attack is from a piercing or slashing manufactured weapon, the weapon also takes this damage.

You turn one type of golem into another. The golem must be willing&mdash;it must be commanded to transform by its master or must be a creature able to make informed decisions that opts to submit to the spell. You must provide various powdered metals with a value equal to 150% of the difference in creation costs between the old and new type of golem, even if the new golem type is cheaper to create.

This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures are affected as well. A magic object made of metal effectively has spell resistance equal to 20 + its caster level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood take a &minus;2 penalty on attack and damage rolls.

The armor bonus of any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.

This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush or similar material thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.
</p>

<p>
If <i>transmute rock to mud</i> is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the targeted area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
</p>

<p>
Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since <i>transmute rock to mud</i> can&rsquo;t affect worked stone and doesn&rsquo;t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings&rsquo; foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.
</p>

<p>
The mud remains until a successful <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>transmute mud to rock</i> spell restores its substance&mdash;but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

This spell allows you to add a creature&rsquo;s stolen face to or remove such a face that you&rsquo;ve already applied from your own. Before casting this spell, you must remove the face and eyes of a creature that has been dead no longer than 1 minute per caster level and place it over your own. Once you cast <i>transplant visage</i>, the creature&rsquo;s stolen skin magically melds with your own, making the expressions and eye color on your new face seem perfectly natural. Your new appearance grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks. Because the alteration made by <i>transplant visage</i> is permanent, there is no residual magical aura, and your new appearance is not recognized by <i>detect</i> spells. <i>Transplant visage</i> may be cast innumerable times, allowing a single caster to wear layers upon layers of stolen faces. However, only the topmost face is visible at any one time.
</p>

<p>
<i>Transplant visage</i> may also be used to remove a previously stolen face. This is the only way to remove a face short of using <i>greater polymorph</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. When used in this way, <i>transplant visage</i> causes the topmost face to flake off and crumble into dust. A face so removed may not be reused. If the caster is wearing several stolen faces when the topmost face is removed, the next face down is revealed, and may be used as normal.

You can enter any normal plant (equal to your size or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The plants must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the <i>transport via plants</i> spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location.

<i>Trap the soul</i> forces a creature&rsquo;s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform.

If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.
<tr>
	<th>	Trigger Object:
	<td>	The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature&rsquo;s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature&rsquo;s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A <i>sympathy</i> spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.

Unlike the invisible sensor created by <i>arcane eye</i>, children of any race (no older than the human equivalent of 10) and animals can see your dreamscryer. Sleeping creatures can sense its presence and might incorporate your image into their dreams. Force effects and abjuration spells that ward out creatures (such as <i>magic circle against evil</i>) are effective barriers against a dreamscryer (regardless of your creature type, alignment, or other specifics).

Even the closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature.

While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form.

When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to step into a tree, magically infusing yourself with the plant. Once within a tree, you can teleport from that particular tree to another tree. The trees you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range; see below and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.

</table> 

<p>
You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round action.
</p>

<p>
You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.

<p>
You test a creature&rsquo;s purity of convictions by exposing it to a sheet of divine fire. Unless the target&rsquo;s alignment is within one step of your deity&rsquo;s, the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6 points of damage). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. Additionally, if the target has an element of its alignment that is in direct opposition to your (chaos opposes law and evil opposes good), you can also attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target as a free action.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Audiovisual Hallucination">audiovisual hallucination</a></i>, except that this spell&rsquo;s phantasm has no apparent effect until a specific condition occurs. You must overcome the target&rsquo;s spell resistance to plant the <i>triggered hallucination</i>, but the target doesn&rsquo;t attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with <i>audiovisual hallucination</i>). The phantasm can include auditory, olfactory, visual, tactile, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.
</p>

<p>
You set the triggering condition (such as hearing a certain word or seeing a type of creature) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger can&rsquo;t be based on any quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. <i>Triggered hallucination</i> uses the target&rsquo;s senses to notice triggers.

You animate a rope, vine, or similar object so that it attempts to trip any creature that comes near. The rope attacks anything in a 10-foot-square area you designate. The rope does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB is equal to your caster level +2. A tripped target that was running, jumping, or charging takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Creatures aware of the tripvine gain a +4 bonus to their CMD against it.

<i>True form</i> removes any polymorph effect from a target creature, returning it to its true form, even against its will. Against creatures affected by polymorph spell effects (such as <i>baleful polymorph</i> or <i>giant form</i>), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the polymorph immediately ends.
</p>

<p>
A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its shape.

You create a massive wave of water that then moves in a straight line across water or land&mdash;you select the direction the wave travels (which must be perpendicular to its width), but once set in motion, the wave cannot change course. Over the surface of open water, the wave travels at a speed of 60 feet per round&mdash;on land or underwater, the wave travels at a speed of 30 feet per round.
</p>

<p>
Creatures struck by a tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage).
</p>

<p>
In addition, the tsunami makes a special CMB check against any creature it strikes&mdash;the wave&rsquo;s CMB is equal to your caster level + your relevant spellcasting ability score modifier (whichever is highest) + 8 (for the wave&rsquo;s size). If this CMB check defeats a creature&rsquo;s CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave&rsquo;s CMB check&mdash;if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half ) and continues being carried along by the wave.
</p>

<p>
Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave&rsquo;s journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space&mdash;if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. <i>Freedom of movement</i> prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.
</p>

<p>
A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.

<p>
You create a darkly sinister floating knife that attacks the same creature as you each round. If you choose not to attack a creature, or you make an attack that affects multiple opponents, the knife makes no attack during that round.
</p>

<p>
The knife uses your base attack bonus modified by either your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher) when making this attack. Unless you specifically will it to do otherwise, or it proves impossible to do so, the knife always maneuvers itself so that it can flank your opponent before making the attack. The knife deals 1d4 points of force damage on a successful hit and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a normal dagger. In addition, if the target is denied a Dexterity bonus to AC or the knife flanks the target, the knife can make sneak attacks as a rogue, inflicting an extra 1d6 points of force damage per four caster levels on a successful attack.
</p>

<p>
A <i>twilight knife</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>a sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>twilight knife</i>&rsquo;s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object) plus your Dexterity modifier.
</p>

<p>
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>twilight knife</i> strikes it. If the knife is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

This extract splits a perfect double of yourself from your body, dressed and equipped exactly as you are. You are able to shift your consciousness from one body to the other once each round as a free action. This shift takes place either immediately before your turn or immediately after it, but not during the round. You may act normally in the body you inhabit. Your other self is treated as though dazed, except it may take a single move action each round during your turn. Your twin cannot speak while you are in your other body, and cannot flank, make attacks of opportunity, or otherwise threaten enemies.
</p>

<p>
Both you and your twin have the same statistics and start with the number of hit points you had when you ingested the extract. Once you have split, these hit points are tracked separately. Any spells, extracts, or magical effects (such as from potions) that were active when you ingested the extract are active for both you and your twin. If any such effects expire, are dispelled, dismissed, or otherwise used or ended, they end for both of you. Extracts or spells cast after you split affect you and your twin as though you were two separate targets. Your equipment is linked between your two selves, and if an item on one is consumed or destroyed, its duplicate is used up or destroyed as well.
</p>

<p>
The body you do not inhabit crumbles into dust when the extract&rsquo;s duration expires or is dismissed. If the body you inhabit is destroyed, you immediately shift to your surviving self and the extract immediately ends. The body you left behind crumbles into dust, and you are stunned until the start of your next turn. If the body you do not inhabit is destroyed, the extract also ends immediately, but you suffer no ill effects.
</p>

<p>
You have no special ability to sense what your second body is experiencing, though you immediately know if it has been destroyed. You may switch between bodies at any distance on the same plane. If your bodies cross into separate planes (including through the use of <i>teleport</i> or <i>blink</i>), the body you inhabit survives, while your other body is destroyed.

As <i><a href="#Simulacrum">simulacrum</a></i>, except you can only duplicate yourself, and the duplicate is created from cloth and twine rather than ice and snow. The double looks exactly like you except its eyes are balls of twine (DC 10 Perception check to recognize double&rsquo;s strange eyes). It wears clothing and gear that appear exactly like what you are wearing at the time of casting. Its copies of your magic items are nonfunctional but radiate magic and have the same auras as your items. Its aura is identical to yours. Attempts to scry you while the double exists have a 50% chance of targeting the double instead of you.
</p>

<p>
The double cannot attack, has no special abilities, and has a +0 bonus on all saves and checks. You may verbally give the double orders as a free action, or control it telepathically as a standard action. You know what the double is experiencing, and when controlling it telepathically you can see and hear everything it sees and hears, though events at your location may drown out the sensory inputs from the double. The double has hit points equal to half your hit points at the time of casting. If brought to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, reverting to cloth and twine. The double is an animated object.

By rearranging the threads of fate, you disrupt fortunate outcomes for other creatures. A creature affected by this spell is unable to benefit from effects that grant the ability to roll multiple times and take the higher result (like the swashbuckler&rsquo;s charmed life ability) or to choose the die result in lieu of rolling (like the wizard&rsquo;s prescience school power or the cyclops&rsquo;s flash of insight ability). This doesn&rsquo;t affect abilities that force a creature to take the lower of two rolls, such as <i>ill omen</i> or a pugwampi&rsquo;s unluck aura. A cyclops can&rsquo;t use its flash of insight ability to save against this spell.

A shadowy afterimage trails behind the targeted weapon, potentially damaging foes even when the weapon misses. Once per round, when the weapon&rsquo;s wielder misses a creature with the target weapon, the wielder can reroll the attack. If the reroll hits, the spell hits the targeted creature and deals 1d8 points of cold damage, plus 1 additional point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spell damages the target. If the creature successfully resists <i>umbral weapon</i>, the spell is dispelled. If not, the creature takes damage as normal.

You fill the target with a terrible loathing aimed at a specific creature. At the time of the casting, you designate a single creature as the object of the target&rsquo;s revulsion. Thereafter, the target does all it can to remain at least 60 feet away from the object of its loathing. As soon as the target moves within this range, it becomes nauseated until it can again get away from the object of its revulsion. If traveling beyond 60 feet of the object of its loathing would place the target in obvious physical danger, the target can attempt a second save to break the spell&rsquo;s effect.

The target creature gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that rely on negative emotions (such as <i>crushing despair</i>, <i>rage</i>, or fear effects) or that would force him to harm an ally (such as <i>confusion</i>). If the target is already under such an effect when receiving this spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of this spell. It does not affect mind-affecting effects based on positive emotions (such as <i>good hope</i> or the inspire cou<i>rage</i> bard ability). A creature can still be charmed or otherwise magically controlled while under this spell&rsquo;s effects, but if such a creature ever receives a new saving throw against that effect as a result of being ordered to attempt to harm or otherwise oppose a true ally, he can roll that saving throw twice and take the better result as his actual roll.

This spell creates an animated replica of the target drawn from the target&rsquo;s subconscious. This living memory is an animated form of the target&rsquo;s negative thoughts and emotions and is intent on destroying the target entirely. The living memory appears to be an exact replica of the target creature, but upon inspection it is obviously a construct. It uses the statistics of a clockwork angel except that it has an Intelligence of 10 and does not have the clockwork trait, the enhance weapon ability, or vulnerability to electricity. If the living memory is destroyed, it vanishes entirely, including any replicas of equipment.
</p>

<p>
You do not control the living memory. The living memory constantly attacks the target. The nature of the living memory causes the target to become unsettled. Roll on the following table to determine how the target acts while the living memory is in sight. If the result offers a saving throw, the DC is equal to that of this spell. The result remains in effect for as long as the living memory is in sight. If the target loses sight of the living memory and then sees it again, roll on the chart again.

<p>
This spell plants a subconscious directive in the target&rsquo;s mind that forces him to act as you dictate when specific circumstances arise. The target humanoid can be either conscious or unconscious, but must understand your language. Upon casting this spell, you must state a course of action you wish the target to take. This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under which you wish the target to take this action, also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words cause the spell to fail. <i>Unconscious agenda</i> cannot compel a target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast.
</p>

<p>
If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he wishes until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell <i><a href="#Dominate Person">dominate person</a></i>. (If the compelled action is against the victim&rsquo;s nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus against the spell to end its effects.) For the next hour, the target acts as you dictated, doing all he can to fulfill your command. If, at the end of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. Once the course of action is completed, the spell ends. The target has full memory of acts performed during this hour.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s difficult to detect an <i>unconscious agenda</i> before the spell is triggered. Casting <i>detect magic</i> on one affected by it only reveals an aura of enchantment if the caster of <i>detect magic</i> has a higher caster level then the caster of <i>unconscious agenda</i>. Even if the spell is detected, it can only be removed by <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. <i>Dispel magic</i> does not affect <i>unconscious agenda</i>.

This spell functions as <i><a href="#Undead Anatomy III">undead anatomy III</a></i>, except it allows you to use more abilities. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: burrow 60 feet, climb 90 feet, fly 120 feet (good maneuverability), swim 120 feet, blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 90 feet, lifesense 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, tremorsense 60 feet, breath weapon, constrict, DR 10/magic and silver, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, fast healing 5, fiery death, fire aura, grab, incorporeal, jet, poison, pounce, rake, rend, roar, spikes, trample, trip, and web.

<p>
If the creature&rsquo;s form is incorporeal, the spell&rsquo;s duration is in rounds per level instead of minutes per level, and your bite and claw (or slam) attacks are incorporeal touch attacks. If the creature has immunity or resistance to any energy types, you gain resistance 30 to those energy types. If the creature has vulnerability to an energy type, you gain that vulnerability.
</p>

<p>
In this form, you gain a +8 bonus on saves against mindaffecting effects, disease, poison, sleep, and stunning. If the form has a vulnerability to an attack (such as sunlight), you gain that vulnerability.

You alter an undead creature&rsquo;s energy affinity so that it takes damage from negative energy and gains healing from positive energy, as if it were a living creature. If the target was able to channel negative energy or produce negative energy effects (such as inflict spells), these abilities produce positive energy instead, healing living targets and harming the undead. The target cannot impose negative levels on other creatures for the duration of the spell. The target&rsquo;s creature type does not change, and it is still considered an undead creature. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

You grant the target the ability to pick up on the subtle scents and disturbances to the natural order that are specific to the living dead, granting the target the ability to sense the presence of undead creatures. The target is constantly aware of whether there are any undead auras within 60 feet of her in any direction. If at least one undead aura is present, the target can concentrate on the spell&rsquo;s effects in order to gain more information on the auras present. This functions similarly to <i><a href="#Detect Undead">detect undead</a></i>, except the number of rounds of concentration needed to learn about the undead auras is reduced by 1 (1 round to learn the number of auras, and 2 rounds to learn the strength and location of each aura).

You create a pale silver barrier that repels undead. Mindless undead and intelligent undead with fewer Hit Dice than your caster level cannot enter the area or penetrate the barrier.
</p>

<p>
Undead of Hit Dice equal to or greater than your caster level can pass through this barrier by making a successful Will save against the spell, but as they do so, they take 3d6 points of damage. Once an undead creature makes its save again this spell and takes this damage, it can come and go without further penalty. This spell may only be used defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an undeath ward against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.

You shroud a single trap with a powerful illusion to make it more difficult to locate. Spells like <i>detect magic</i> can&rsquo;t locate any magic aura from either the target trap or from <i>undetectable trap</i>. Furthermore, a character under the effect of the <i>find traps</i> spell doesn&rsquo;t receive an automatic chance to locate the target trap when she comes within 10 feet of it, and the bonus on Perception checks from <i>find traps</i> doesn&rsquo;t apply to attempts to notice the target trap. Add &frac12; your caster level to the DC for any creature without the trapfinding class ability to notice the target trap with Perception checks.

A ranger with the ranger traps class feature can cast this spell on a ranger trap he creates as part of the same action he uses to prepare a ranger trap.

The target loses its body&rsquo;s natural ability to breathe automatically. As long as it remains conscious and is able to take physical actions, it keeps breathing and is able to function normally. If it is ever unconscious (including sleeping) or unable to take physical actions, it stops breathing, must hold its breath, and might begin to suffocate. Creatures that do not have to breathe are immune to this spell.

During this spell&rsquo;s duration, you can touch the sign of a creature&rsquo;s passage that you have identified using the Survival skill to make the other steps in the creature&rsquo;s path perfectly clear to you, no matter how minute. This trail can&rsquo;t be more than 24 hours old. You can follow the trail at any speed, provided you have line of sight to the trail. You can distinguish the trail of the particular creature followed even if it joins and splits with other trails. Once you have selected a trail to follow using this spell, it can&rsquo;t be changed.
</p>

<p>
The spell is unable to follow teleportation or interplanar travel for any distance. The trail appears to end where the creature teleported (though a successful Spellcraft check allows you to determine the method of teleportation, if a spell was used). <i>Unerring tracker</i> can&rsquo;t track creatures under the effect of a <i>pass without trace</i> spell, as those creatures leave no trail at all, but can track creatures using <i>nondetection</i> (though not <i>mind blank</i>).
</p>

<p>
This spell can be used to track flying creatures, but the trail must at least begin on a solid surface.
</p>

<p>
This spell doesn&rsquo;t reveal the creature&rsquo;s current position or any shorter path than the one it followed (for instance, it will not reveal that the creature doubled back upon the trail until you reach the point where the creature turned around.) It doesn&rsquo;t reveal traps or other hazards along the trail.

This spell breaks the life link between you and your eidolon. This spell allows your eidolon to venture more than 100 feet away from you without penalty. It can travel any distance while this spell is in effect without penalty, but if the spell expires while the eidolon is farther than 100 feet away, it immediately loses hit points as normal for distance and is possibly sent back to its home plane. While this spell is in effect, you cannot sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to your eidolon. Damage that would be transferred due to the life bond ability is not transferred. If you attempt to use the transposition ability while this spell is in effect, you must roll on the <i><a href="#Teleport">teleport</a></i> mishap table, using the &ldquo;studied carefully&rdquo; row.

When a creature attempts to touch you with an attack (such as a touch attack, an unarmed strike, an attack with a natural weapon, or a grapple), it feels a field of force blocking its way. It can choose to abandon the attempt, losing its action, or to push through the ward. If it pushes through, you can trigger a wave of force against that creature. This discharges the spell, deals 1d4 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and pushes the creature back 5 feet. If the creature cannot be pushed back 5 feet (if a solid surface is directly behind it, for example), it takes 2d4 additional points of force damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the total amount of force damage the creature takes.

<i>Unhallow</i> makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.
</p>

<p>
First, the site or structure is guarded by a <i><a href="#Magic Circle Against Good">magic circle against good</a></i> effect.
</p>

<p>
Second, the DC to resist negative channeled energy within the spell&rsquo;s area of effect gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist positive energy is reduced by 4. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the <i>unhallowed</i> site. The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting <i>unhallow</i> again.
</p>

<p>
Spell effects that may be tied to an <i>unhallowed</i> include <i>aid</i>, <i>bane</i>, <i>bless</i>, <i>cause fear</i>, <i>darkness</i>, <i>daylight</i>, <i>death ward</i>, <i>deeper darkness</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>dimensional anchor</i>, <i>discern lies</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>endure elements</i>, <i>freedom of movement</i>, <i>invisibility purge</i>, <i>protection from energy</i>, <i>remove fear</i>, <i>resist energy</i>, <i>silence</i>, <i>tongues</i>, and <i>zone of truth</i>.

<p>
Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells&rsquo; effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.) An area can receive only one <i>unhallow</i> spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time.

A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by good creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.
</p>

<p>
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of <i>protection from good</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures.
</p>

<p>
Second, a warded creature gains SR 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures.
</p>

<p>
Third, the abjuration protects the subjects from possession and mental influence, just as <i><a href="#Protection from Good">protection from good</a></i> does.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (Fortitude negates).

<p>
You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.
</p>

<p>
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i>, but <i>remove curse</i> is effective.
</p>

<p>
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.

This spell allows you to channel the powers of evil into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a <i>+5 unholy weapon</i> (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against good opponents).
</p>

<p>
It also emits a <i><a href="#Magic Circle Against Good">magic circle against good</a></i> effect (as the spell). If the <i>magic circle</i> ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one <i>unholy sword</i> at a time.
</p>

<p>
If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with any spells that modify the weapon in any way.
</p>

<p>
This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon&rsquo;s bonus to attack does not stack with this spell&rsquo;s enhancement bonus to attack.

You call upon the wild winds of the Abyssal atmosphere, howling with the screams of damned and demented souls in torment. The area is filled with winds of windstorm strength, blowing in a random direction each round. Creatures within the area of effect are deafened as long as they remain within the area and for 1d4 rounds thereafter; however, they continue to hear the sounds of screams in their minds with painful intensity, causing them to become shaken for as long as they remain deafened. A successful Will save negates the shaken condition but not the deafness.

By touching a creature with a bladed instrument, you cause the creature&rsquo;s flesh to loosen and slide against its skeletal moorings. A living creature touched becomes staggered by the disturbing and uncomfortable sensation for 1 round per level. Each round on its turn, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A corporeal undead creature targeted by this spell instead takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d6 at 5th level) as wet, oozing chunks of flesh slough off its desiccated bones (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Incorporeal creatures, or creatures that do not have flesh, are immune to this spell&rsquo;s effects.

An unseen crew member has a Strength score of 10 and a Profession (sailor) score equal to half your character level plus your Intelligence modifier (for witches and wizards) or your Charisma modifier (for bards, sorcerers, and summoners).

You conjure an invisible team of tiny engineers to construct a trap at alarming speed. Originating at your location, the team must remain within range of you or the spell ends. The engineers construct a mechanical trap of your choice. Construction takes a number of rounds equal to the trap&rsquo;s challenge rating. The engineers must have the materials available. At the end of the construction time, use your Craft (traps) skill with a +5 bonus to determine the success of their work. If the engineers succeed, the trap is complete and the spell ends. If they fail, the materials are deposited at that location and the spell ends. If the spell&rsquo;s duration ends before the trap is complete, the engineers automatically fail.
</p>

<p>
The engineers move at your base speed and can carry only materials required in the construction of the desired trap. They can&rsquo;t attack in any way or be killed, and dissipate if they take 12 points of damage from area attacks (they get no saves against attacks).

An <i>unseen servant</i> is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can&rsquo;t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can&rsquo;t be used untrained. This servant cannot fly, climb, or even swim (though it can walk on water). Its base speed is 15 feet.
</p>

<p>
The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell&rsquo;s range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

Those in this spell&rsquo;s area who fail their Will saving throws harbor a faint sense of paranoia and evoke the same feeling in others for the duration of the spell. Domesticated animals (not including familiars and animal companions) don&rsquo;t willingly approach affected creatures unless the animal&rsquo;s master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. Affected creatures take a &minus;4 penalty on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks against familiars, animal companions, animal cohorts, and other permanent companions provided by class abilities for the spell&rsquo;s duration. Anyone an affected creature interacts with must succeed at a Will save or have its initial attitude automatically worsened by one step for the spell&rsquo;s duration. Every time an affected creature attempts a Sense Motive check to get a hunch or detect a Bluff from another creature (or vice versa), it must succeed at a Will save or automatically assume the other party is lying or otherwise harbors ill will against it. Each time this spell causes an affected creature (or someone interacting with the affected creature) to attempt a Will saving throw, the spell&rsquo;s hauntlike manifestation occurs.

Prized among those who seek to monitor the attention paid to them, this spell is said to be used by Arazni to identify those followers who dare refer to her as &ldquo;the Harlot Queen&rdquo; so she might summarily dismiss them.

If a creature within 1 mile of you uses that word, phrase, or name to refer to you, you immediately learn that creature&rsquo;s name, appearance, and location. This discharges the spell.

Penalties that the target would take as a result of an emotion effect are instead treated as morale bonuses equal to half the penalty&rsquo;s value (for example, if the target were affected by a <i>crushing despair</i> spell, she would gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls, instead of the spell&rsquo;s normal effect). Furthermore, morale bonuses she gains from other sources are increased by 1. Finally, the target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist spells of the pattern subschool, as her childlike wonder allows her to marvel at the beauty of such effects without being overwhelmed by them.

This spell causes the target to glow as if surrounded by a halo of light. This halo sheds normal light in a 20-foot radius from the creature, and increases the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet. This halo makes it impossible for the creature to gain concealment in nonmagical darkness, and in dim or darker conditions, the creature&rsquo;s glow can be seen even if it is not within direct line of sight.
</p>

<p>
If <i>unwelcome halo</i> is brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa), the effects of both spells are temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist within the overlapping fields of effect.

Like <i><a href="#Shield Other">shield other</a></i>, <i>unwilling shield</i> creates a mystic connection between you and the target, but unlike <i>shield other</i>, the target shares the wounds that you receive. In addition, the link draws upon the target&rsquo;s life force to supplement your own defenses. You gain a +1 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. You take only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by the target. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as <i>charm</i> effects, ability damage, level draining, and death effects are not affected. If you take a reduction in hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target because it is not hit point damage.
</p>

<p>
When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subject, but damage already split is not assigned to you.
</p>

<p>
If you and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell remains active, but damage is no longer shared until you are once again within range of each other.

You become one with the city around you, allowing you to move more easily through its crowds and buildings. For the duration of this spell, your base land speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, it does not cost you 2 squares of movement to enter a square with crowds, though the crowd still provides cover to you. This ability does not allow you to enter the space of enemy creatures without making the appropriate Acrobatics check. In addition, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move across uneven urban surfaces, such as roofs and broken pavement, and on Climb checks made to scale walls and other artificial surfaces. Whenever you make an Acrobatics check to make a long jump between two buildings or artificial structures, you are always treated as if you had a running start, regardless of the actual distance traveled.

Both portals must be open and unobstructed when you cast the spell and enter the first portal, and they both must be large enough for you to fit through, otherwise the spell ends and the teleportation fails. You can bring along objects as long as their combined weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You can&rsquo;t bring other creatures with you, and other creatures that go through the portals don&rsquo;t teleport.

You shroud an area in Urgathoa&rsquo;s unclean influence, rendering those who pass through it and fail their Will saving throws more enticing to ravenous undead. When an affected creature comes within 60 feet of an undead creature, the spell immediately draws the undead creature&rsquo;s attention, granting it a +4 bonus on Perception checks to notice the affected creature and on saving throws to resist spells that hide or disguise the affected creature (such as <i>hide from undead</i>). Once the undead creature notices the affected creature, it feels compelled to kill and devour the affected creature, and gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls made against the affected creature and a +1 profane bonus on saving throws against the affected creature&rsquo;s spells and special abilities. The undead also ignores any concealment less than total concealment that an affected creature has. Each time the spell draws an undead creature&rsquo;s attention to an affected creature, the spell&rsquo;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.

For the duration of this spell, the target gains the ability to drain an opponent&rsquo;s blood during a grapple; if the target establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

This spell causes a number of miniature comets (up to one per four caster levels) to orbit in the air above your head. Bits of snow and cold wind drift down from the orbiting comets, granting you a circumstance bonus equal to the number of comets on all saving throws against fire effects.
</p>

<p>
The actual use for the comets, though, is to make vengeful strikes against foes who dare to target you with offensive spells. As an immediate action whenever you are affected by a spell cast by another creature, you can fire one of your <i>vengeful comets</i> as a bolt of icy retribution (provided the source of the offensive spell is within range of your <i>vengeful comet</i>, of course). The comet requires a ranged touch attack to hit. If it hits, a comet deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 3d6 points of cold damage to the target, plus an additional amount of cold damage equal to the level of the spell you are retaliating against. If the spell you&rsquo;re retaliating against had the fire descriptor, you may opt to fire two comets instead of one.

The target is under the of a <i><a href="#Geas/Quest">geas</a></i> to find and capture or kill this enemy, and the target takes the penalties of that spell as long as it is not actively trying to reach the enemy.

When you touch the poison vial against the target creature and cast this spell, the vial drains and the target&rsquo;s teeth become envenomed with the same poison. The creature gains the use of 1 dose of the poison for every 5 caster levels you possess (maximum 4 doses). The creature gains immunity to that poison while this spell is in effect. The poison retains its normal properties, and this spell does not alter the DC to resist or cure the poison.
</p>

<p>
Each successful bite attack counts as an expended dose. When all the poison is used, the spell ends. If the target creature doesn&rsquo;t have a bite attack, or if the target&rsquo;s bite attack is already poisonous, the spell has no effect. If the target has multiple heads, the spell affects only one bite attack.
</p>

<p>
When this spell ends, any unused poison is harmlessly expelled from the target&rsquo;s mouth and cannot be used again.

You guard your words and person with poisonous power. You can impart a short amount of information&mdash;up to 25 words&mdash;as you cast this spell, entwining your words with the poison provided as a material component. If your target reveals the information you impart (verbally, in writing, with gestures, or by having its mind read with spells like <i>detect thoughts</i>), the target is immediately exposed to the poison (and is allowed any saving throw the poison allows).
</p>

<p>
Your target instinctively knows that revealing this information will endanger it, but doesn&rsquo;t automatically understand why or how. <i>Neutralize poison</i> removes the effect of this spell; the spellcaster must succeed at a caster level check against the spell&rsquo;s save DC rather than the poison&rsquo;s.

You partially transform your body into a swarm of bats, insects, rats, and spiders. As a standard action, you can send out a piece of your body to attack up to four Medium or smaller creatures (or one larger creature) within 10 feet of you. The creatures take 4d6 points of damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage and 1d3 points of Strength damage; the ability damage is a poison effect. Abilities that protect against swarm attacks apply to this damage and spell resistance applies.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, since your body is partially a swarm, you take only half damage from piercing and slashing attacks, unless those attacks would deal full damage or greater to a swarm (for instance, an area piercing attack would deal full damage to you). You can still be targeted by single-target spells but you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against them.

Casting spells in this form is difficult and any spells with somatic components require a concentration check as if casting defensively; if you are also casting the spell defensively, roll a single concentration check at a &minus;5 penalty.

The giants and their kin have long plagued the peoples of Varisia, particularly the Shoanti of the Storval Plateau. Among the various tactics and methods the Shoanti have developed to fight against their enemies, this spell is one of the most widespread today.
</p>

<p>
When you cast <i>vex giant</i>, your senses and reflexes become particularly honed against a single target within 60 feet, provided the target is at least one size category larger than you. You may select your focused foe as a free action when you cast this spell&mdash;switching your focus to a different foe within 60 feet is a move action. If a foe moves beyond 60 feet from you, you lose your focus on that foe, although you may regain it by moving within 60 feet and spending a move action. Although the name of the spell is <i>vex giant</i>, it works equally well on any foe that&rsquo;s at least one size category larger than you.
</p>

<p>
Against a foe you are focused on, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity by moving through their threatened area. Additionally, the first successful melee attack you make against the foe in a round deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. Finally, you gain a +4 insight bonus on all combat maneuver checks made against your focused foe.

You transform one or more dogs into evil, monstrous creatures. Each dog can attempt a Will save to negate the transformation, but if the dog trusts you (it has been trained by you for a purpose, or has been in your care for at least 30 days and generally treated well), it takes a &minus;4 penalty on this saving throw. Each transformed dog has the same stats as a hell hound except that it doesn&rsquo;t have fire immunity and cold vulnerability and instead has acid, cold, and fire resistance 5. Additionally, each transformed dog deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage with its bite attack (instead of fire damage), and its breath weapon is replaced with a vaporous cloud that spreads out in front of the creature in a 10-foot cone, dealing 2d4 points of acid damage. The creature can&rsquo;t understand Infernal but understands any languages you know. The dog is normally neutral evil, but is chaotic evil if you are chaotic or lawful evil if you are lawful.
</p>

<p>
For every 3 caster levels you have, you can transform one dog (to a maximum of five dogs at 15th level). At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the dogs immediately dissolve into a stinking pile of gore and bones.
</p>

<p>
You can command the creature in the same way you would a creature you summoned via a <i><a href="#Summon Monster I">summon monster</a></i> spell. If you buy dogs to use with this spell, they cost 15 gp for a lap dog, 25 gp for a guard dog, or 150 gp for a riding dog.

<p>
You throw an illusion over an area to make creatures that view or interact with it believe it has suffered some great catastrophe or calamity that renders it utterly worthless for their needs. You must set a few general guidelines when casting the spell as to the nature of this disaster (fire, tornado, bandit raid, plague, etc.), after which the illusion fills in the remaining details to make it seem realistic. When casting the spell, you can grant creatures with particular, clearly identifiable physical traits (race, gender, age category, etc.) immunity to this spell. This allows all such eligible creatures to perceive the true nature of the affected area instead of its illusory appearance. Creatures without this immunity that fail their saving throws always perceive the affected area as having absolutely nothing of interest or worth to them. Unless they have reason for suspicion, they always move on without closely investigating the area. Creatures with sufficient reasons for suspicion who do choose to investigate the area gain another saving throw, this one with a +2 bonus, as they enter the village and directly interact with the illusion.
</p>

<p>
You can expand the area of this spell by casting it multiple times. Each time you do, you must effectively &ldquo;attach&rdquo; the spell to the existing area by using the same disaster and granting the same sorts of creatures immunity to its effects. If you fail to do this, the entire illusion, no matter how large, disappears.

<p>
Vines choked with thorns, blossoms, leaflets, and other floral debris burst to life on and around the subject of this spell, winding around limbs and armor and making it progressively more difficult for the subject to maneuver. When this spell is cast, the subject may attempt a Reflex save. Success indicates that the vines fail to take root and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the subject&rsquo;s base speed is immediately reduced by 5 feet. Each round thereafter, the subject must make another successful Reflex save or his speed is reduced by another 5 feet. This occurs each round until he is reduced to a speed equal to half of what it was before the spell was cast.
</p>

<p>
As a full-round action, the subject or an adjacent creature can tear the vines off the subject&rsquo;s body, resetting the speed penalty to just 5 feet, though the vines continue to grow each round thereafter for the spell&rsquo;s duration, requiring additional checks, unless it is actually dispelled. The spell&rsquo;s effects can also be prematurely ended by dealing at least 20 points of fire damage to the subject. When the spell&rsquo;s duration ends or the effect is terminated, the vines immediately wilt and the subject&rsquo;s speed returns to normal. Regardless of the subject&rsquo;s base speed, the vines cannot reduce a creature&rsquo;s speed below 5 feet.

This spell has additional effects depending on which version you cast, chosen when you cast the spell.

	<th>	Blessed Thorns:
	<td>	The vines sprout vicious thorns made of celestial steel. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the subject takes 2d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage for each round since the creature last took a full-round action to tear the vines off. When you cast this version of the spell, you can also choose to make the thorns either cold iron or silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
<tr>
	<th>	Noxious Vines:
	<td>	The vines emit noxious fumes that act as a lung and eye irritant. The subject and any creatures adjacent to the subject must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude check each round at the beginning of their turn. On a failed save, the creatures becomes blinded for that round and can&rsquo;t cast spells with verbal components.
<tr>
	<th>	Swift Vines:
	<td>	The vines act twice as quickly as normal, and slow the creature by 10 feet per round instead of 5 feet (though they still can&rsquo;t decrease the creature&rsquo;s speed to less than half). In addition, once the creature is slowed to half-speed, it becomes staggered until the vines are torn off or the spell ends.

You curse the target to suffer a violent accident within the next 24 hours. You have no control over the form the accident takes or when it strikes. The target can avoid being cursed with spell resistance when you cast the spell, but otherwise receives no saving throw. Regardless of the accident&rsquo;s nature, it is magically empowered to deal an amount of damage equal to 1d8 &times; your caster level (maximum 5d8 points of damage), and the damage is of a type appropriate to the source of damage (such as fire for an explosion or bludgeoning for a falling object). When the accident occurs, the target can attempt a Reflex saving throw to reduce the damage by half. Although others might be surprised or inconvenienced by the accident, it damages only the target.

This spell creates a chaotic charge within the black powder loaded in a target firearm. The next time the target weapon fires during this spell&rsquo;s duration, it automatically misfires. If this misfire causes the firearm to explode, the radius of the explosion is doubled and it deals maximum damage to all creatures in the radius. The firearm&rsquo;s wielder also takes 1d6 additional points of fire damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6) you have.

If the target is an advanced firearm, and the firearm misfires a second time in a row while this spell is in effect, it does not explode but still deals the additional damage to the wielder as described.

Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract&rsquo;s duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the word &ldquo;bomb admixture&rdquo; in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active.
</p>

<p>
When you throw a bomb and hit a target directly, up to four vipers are released from the bomb. One viper attacks the target of the direct hit, and the other vipers attack up to three creatures that take damage from the splash damage. The vipers make melee touch attacks (using your base attack bonus + Intelligence modifier) and on a hit deal 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier damage, and the target is poisoned as if by a venomous snake. Hit or miss, the conjured vipers disappear after they make the attack. The conjured snakes are not damaged or adversely affected by the bombs you throw.

This spell functions exactly as the spell <i><a href="#Nightmare">nightmare</a></i>. In addition to the effects of that spell, you can cause a second spell to be delivered when the target wakes at the <i>nightmare&rsquo;s</i> conclusion.
</p>

<p>
You must have this second spell prepared, and it must be cast immediately after <i>vision of Lamashtu</i> (effectively adding the two spells&rsquo; casting times). This second spell &ldquo;rides along&rdquo; with the <i>nightmare</i>, affecting the target as soon as it wakes from its fitful sleep. Any spell can be sent along with the <i>nightmare</i>, so long as it is of 6th level or lower, affects one target (which is always the <i>nightmare</i>&rsquo;s recipient), and does not deal hit point damage. The second spell&rsquo;s range is irrelevant for the purposes of <i>vision of Lamashtu</i>, and even touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must still make a successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with the act of touching occurring within the context of the victim&rsquo;s <i>nightmare</i>). The target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed. For example, a cleric of Lamashtu could send <i>bestow curse</i> along as part of a <i>vision of Lamashtu</i>, but not <i>blade barrier</i> (affects an area), <i>destruction</i> (too high level), or <i>inflict moderate wounds</i> (deals hit point damage).

You choose any language (except for secret languages, such as Druidic). The target gains the ability to speak, understand, read, and write that language.

Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute.

If the target lacks the mental capacity to grasp a language, it still gains enough knowledge to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached in the language (whether written or spoken).

If the twin is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, although you can create a new one on your turn as a standard action as long as the duration persists. You cannot have more than one vomit twin at a time.

You create a powerful and immobile whirlpool in any body of liquid large enough to contain the spell&rsquo;s effect. Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be pulled into the whirlpool and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed.

You may direct the whirlpool to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish. A boat that is equal in length or shorter than the vortex&rsquo;s width that passes through a vortex takes 6d6 points of damage and is caught up by the current. If the boat&rsquo;s captain makes a DC 25 Profession (sailor) check (or if the boat is longer than the vortex&rsquo;s width), the boat takes only half damage and is not caught up by the vortex.

You make the targets light enough to be carried by wind. Creatures affected by this spell suffer cumulative penalties for attacking as if under the effects of <i><a href="#Levitate">levitate</a></i> unless they have a fly speed. Treat each target as two size categories lighter for the purposes of being checked or blown away by wind. If a target has a fly speed, it can fly overland at the wind&rsquo;s speed in the same direction as the wind by succeeding at a DC 20 Fly check. If a creature flying overland this way attempts to change direction, it risks being blown away as usual. By linking hands or creating a connection with rope, creatures affected by this spell can be towed through the air by a flying creature as if each weighed only one-eighth its actual weight.

You and your mount lay down a trail of glowing, heavenly mist behind you as you move that makes passage easier for good creatures but more difficult for evil creatures. This glowing trail of mist appears behind your mount in a straight line starting where you cast the spell and ending where your mount ends its movement. The mist takes the form of a path 10 feet wide and up to 120 feet long and always floats just above the ground, up to a height of 1 foot. Thereafter, the mist persists for 1 round per level.
</p>

<p>
Good creatures may walk along the top of the mist as if it were solid, treating squares of difficult terrain containing the mist as normal terrain. Evil creatures find the mist thick and cloying, and treat squares of normal terrain containing the mist as difficult terrain instead. Neutral creatures pass through the mist with no effect. The mist has no effect on obstacles or otherwise impassable terrain, and does not block sight or provide concealment.
</p>

<p>
Except for very special circumstances (such as a celestial or fiendish mount), mounts use the alignment of their rider when determining how this spell affects them. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your mount, the spell immediately ends, although the mist remains for the spell&rsquo;s normal duration.

A wake of light cannot follow across water, underwater, or through the air in the case of a mount capable of walking on water, swimming, or flight.

This spell functions as per <i><a href="#Create Pit">create pit</a></i>, except as noted here. All but the top 10 feet of the hole is filled with saltwater, reducing the fall damage for anyone falling into the pit to 1d3 points of nonlethal damage and allowing Huge or larger creatures at the water&rsquo;s surface to simply pull themselves out of the pit as part of a normal move action, without a Climb check. Additionally, the pit contains a single advanced shark for every 4 caster levels you have (maximum four advanced sharks). If desired, when you cast the spell, you can substitute two of the summoned sharks for one great white shark. These sharks immediately attack any creature that falls into the pit, even you. If multiple creatures fall in the pit, the sharks attack randomly. When the spell ends, creatures inside the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit, as normal for <i>create pit</i>, but the conjured water and sharks vanish.

This spell creates a vertical wall of skeletal arms that attaches itself to any solid surface. The <i>wall of bone</i> works identically to <i><a href="#Wall of Stone">wall of stone</a></i> except as noted above and in this spell description. The <i>wall of bone</i> is 1 inch thick per 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. The wall created must be vertical, and must rest upon a firm foundation. It cannot be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or to act as a ramp. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 4 and 7 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drops to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC of the Strength check is equal to 15 + 2 per inch of thickness.
</p>

<p>
For each creature adjacent to the wall, the skeletal hands attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple it. The skeletal hands do not provoke attacks of opportunity. They make their attacks at the start of your turn, when the wall is summoned, or when an enemy first moves adjacent to the wall. The skeletal hands&rsquo; CMB is equal to your caster level, and they can grapple a Huge or smaller creature with no penalty.
</p>

<p>
If the wall successfully grapples a foe, that foe takes 1d6 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The wall cannot move or pin foes. Each round the wall succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check, it deals 1d6 additional points of damage. The CMD of the wall, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.

You conjure a 5-foot-thick wall of seawater with a powerful current flowing toward one side of the wall, selected by you; a creature attempting to swim against this current must spend 4 squares of movement to enter a square of the wall. A creature that begins its turn in the wall is ejected in the direction of the current just before it acts. The wall provides cover against attacks from out of the water, as usual for a body of water. The water and the currents deflect physical ranged attacks into or through the wall, unless a weapon used is exceptionally massive (such as a siege engine). A creature submerged in the wall takes the usual penalties for underwater combat. The wall blocks gases and liquids and prevents water from mixing at its edges.

An immobile, vertical wall of spinning cogs and gears springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of piercing and slashing damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6); a successful Reflex save halves the damage.
</p>

<p>
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.

A <i>wall of clockwork</i> is 1 inch thick per 4 caster levels. You can double the wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 9. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness. If an attacker an attack roll of a natural 20 (and only a natural 20, regardless of the weapon&rsquo;s threat range) and confirms the critical hit (even though the wall is otherwise immune to critical hits), that section of wall gains the broken condition. If already broken, that section of wall is destroyed instead.

You draw forth a massive veil of ectoplasm that roils with restless spirits. Immovable once formed, the <i>wall of ectoplasm</i> is 1 inch thick per caster level and covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a <i>wall of ectoplasm</i> 100 feet long and 10 feet h igh, a wall 25 feet long and 40 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion and need not be anchored, but must be created continuous and unbroken. The wall can&rsquo;t include squares that have creatures within them, even if the creatures are on the Ethereal Plane. The wall exists on both the Material Plane and Ethereal Plane, and blocks ethereal and incorporeal creatures from passing through it.
</p>

<p>
One side of the wall, selected by you, radiates a deeply foreboding and menacing aura from the writhing spirits within. The range of this mind-affecting fear effect is 10 feet from the wall&rsquo;s surface, and creatures that are in range when the wall is created or that later approach to within 10 feet must succeed at a Will save or become shaken (or panicked if they have 4 Hit Dice or fewer) for 1 round per your caster level.
</p>

<p>
Each 10-foot square of the wall has 2 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of the wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached, but if a section is destroyed, the remaining ectoplasm in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall&rsquo;s overall size by one 10-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. The wall can also take the form of a sphere or hemisphere whose maximum radius is 1 foot per caster level, and that is as hard to break through as the ectoplasmic plane form.

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area on your turn each round. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.
</p>

<p>
If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points or more of cold damage in 1 round, that length goes away. (Do not divide cold damage by 2, as normal for objects.) <i>Wall of fire</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>wall of fire</i> that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.

You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
</p>

<p>
A <i>wall of iron</i> is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
</p>

<p>
If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. Iron created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects and cannot be sold.

<p>
This spell creates a vertical <i>wall of lava</i> that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A <i>wall of lava</i>&rsquo;s maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a <i>wall of lava</i> can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall&rsquo;s overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a <i>wall of lava</i>, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).
</p>

<p>
A creature can move through a <i>wall of lava</i> as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check&mdash;failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a <i>wall of lava</i> inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A <i>wall of lava</i> also radiates heat as if it were a <i><a href="#Wall of Fire">wall of fire</a></i>, although the heat from a <i>wall of lava</i> radiates from both sides.
</p>

<p>
Once per round as a move action, you can direct the <i>wall of lava</i> to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall&rsquo;s overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a <i>wall of lava</i> from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.
</p>

<p>
All damage inflicted by physical contact with a <i>wall of lava</i> continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).

An immobile, blinding curtain of white light that blocks line of sight springs into existence. The wall sheds bright light to a range of 60 feet in all directions. A creature adjacent to the wall is blinded as long as it remains adjacent plus an additional 1d4 rounds thereafter&mdash;closing its eyes or succeeding at a Fortitude save negates the effect for 1 round. A creature that passes through the wall is automatically blinded, even if its eyes are closed. A creature from the Plane of Shadow gains 1d4 negative levels each round it spends within 5 feet of the wall (Fortitude negates). Passing through the wall imposes a &minus;4 penalty on the save for that round. Twenty-four hours after gaining these negative levels, the subject must attempt a new Fortitude saving throw for each negative level. If a save succeeds, 1 negative level is removed. If it fails, the negative level becomes permanent. <i>Wall of light</i> can be made permanent with <i>permanency</i> (with a minimum caster level of 13th and cost of 11,000 gp).

<p>
With a whispered incantation, you conjure a stationary vertical wall of misty vapor. The wall is straight, is 1 foot thick, and has a length up to 10 feet per caster level. The wall obscures vision, granting concealment (20% miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall. A creature that shares a square with the wall counts as being on neither side of the wall and neither benefits nor suffers from the concealment.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can create a wall with increased density, but doing so reduces the maximum length of the wall to 5 feet per caster level.
</p>

<p>
In addition to granting concealment, this denser wall also hinders movement. Any creature moving into or attempting to pass through the wall must succeed at a DC 15 Strength check or be entangled (and unable to move) until the start of its next turn. A creature that starts its turn in the wall can freely move within it or move out of the wall in either direction.
</p>

<p>
Only a severe or stronger wind (31+ mph) disperses the wall, and it does so in 1 round.

You create a transparent, shimmering wall through which creatures and objects appear to be wildly distorted to viewers. Any creature that passes through the wall is immediately assailed by overwhelming vertigo, becoming nauseated for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save; if nauseated, the creature must also succeed at a DC 12 Acrobatics check or fall prone. Creatures gain partial concealment (20% miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall.
</p>

<p>
The wall must be vertical and rectangular. It need not touch the ground. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature when it is cast, the spell fails.

You create a wall of translucent silver energy that hums and vibrates at the slightest touch. Objects and nonevil creatures can pass through this wall without difficulty. However, spells and effects with the evil descriptor treat this barrier as a <i><a href="#Wall of Force">wall of force</a></i>, which blocks line of effect. Evil creatures that pass through the wall take 3d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum 3d6+20) and are blinded for 1 round. Creatures of any alignment that are particularly vulnerable to silver (such as those with damage reduction bypassed by silver, like devils or lycanthropes) instead take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), are staggered for 1 round, and are permanently blinded. A creature that succeeds at a Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding and staggering effects. If you create a <i>wall of silver</i> so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by succeeding at a Reflex save.

A translucent barrier of pure sound springs into existence. This wall is silent except for a faint hum, but bursts with discordant noise when touched by an object or creature. The wall deflects arrows, bolts, loose debris, and Small or smaller flying creatures like a <i><a href="#Wind Wall">wind wall</a></i> spell, except these things rebound harmlessly rather than being directed upward. The burst of discordant noise deals 2d4 points of sonic damage to creatures within 10 feet of the triggering object or creature; touching or passing through the wall deals 2d6 points of sonic damage + 1 point of sonic damage per caster level (maximum +20). If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.

This effect alters the illumination level by up to two steps toward either bright light (the light side) or darkness (the dark side). The wall also obstructs vision through it, regardless of which side of the wall the viewer is on.

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A <i>wall of stone</i> is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
</p>

<p>
Unlike a <i>wall of iron</i>, you can create a <i>wall of stone</i> in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell&rsquo;s area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
</p>

<p>
Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
</p>

<p>
Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
</p>

<p>
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a <i>wall of stone</i>, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

<p>
You create a wall of glittering motes that suppresses or even negates any magical effect passing through it. The wall appears to have no actual substance and does not physically obstruct or impede anything attempting to move through it. However, the wall exerts a powerful anti-magical effect.
</p>

<p>
Any magic item or magical spell or effect of your caster level or lower that passes through the wall is suppressed for 1 round per level. Spells or effects with durations expire normally, even while thus suppressed. A spell or with a duration greater than that of the suppression resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends.
</p>

<p>
The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spelllike abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a creature&rsquo;s ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration.
</p>

<p>
The wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through the wall, but it does not block line of sight. Magic items or spell effects with a higher caster level than yours are unaffected by the <i>wall of suppression</i>. The wall does not affect artifacts, anything stemming from the direct action of a deity, or similarly powerful sorts of magic.

<p>
A <i>wall of thorns</i> spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human&rsquo;s finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a <i>wall of thorns</i> takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature&rsquo;s AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.) You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
</p>

<p>
Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
</p>

<p>
Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <i>wall of thorns</i> at normal speed without taking damage.
</p>

<p>
A <i>wall of thorns</i> can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.

You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target and swirl around it in a complex pattern. The pattern clearly outlines the target and radiates light as if it were a sunrod, negating any concealment for the target. The target must make a successful Will save. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round and must make another save on its next turn or be dazed again for 1 round. The target must continue making Will saves each round. If a target makes its Will save, the <i>wandering star motes</i> jump to the nearest enemy within 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round or be dazed. Any time a target makes its Will save, the <i>wandering star motes</i> jump to the next nearest enemy within 30 feet.
</p>

<p>
A given creature can only be affected by the <i>wandering star motes</i> once; once a target has successfully saved against the spell, it cannot be affected again. If there are no new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully made its save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy creatures; your allies are not affected.

If a tracking creature exceeds the DC of the skill check to follow the trail by an amount equal to your caster level, the tracker recognizes that the trail has been manipulated by this spell, although it cannot see the trail&rsquo;s true nature unless it uses magical means, such as <i>true seeing</i>.

This spell harnesses the power of the seasons to protect the target and grant a number of bonuses. This spell has one of four different effects. The caster of the spell can select any one of the following four effects, but can change the effect as a standard action that reduces the total remaining duration by 1 hour.
</p>

<table class=Options>
<tr>
	<th>	Spring:
	<td>	The target is wrapped in light vines, culminating in a crown of bright, beautiful flowers. While the spell remains in effect, the target is immune to bleed effects and regains 1 hit point per round whenever below 0 hit points, as long as the target is still alive. This stabilizes the target. For each hit point restored in this way, the spell&rsquo;s total remaining duration is reduced by 1 hour.
<tr>
	<th>	Summer:
	<td>	The target is surrounded by tiny motes of light. While the spell remains in effect, the target&rsquo;s base speed increases 10 feet. The target may instead increase its base speed by 30 feet for 1 round by reducing the spell&rsquo;s total remaining duration by 1 hour.
<tr>
	<th>	Fall:
	<td>	A cloak of autumn leaves appears on the target. While the spell remains in effect, the target gains a +2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves. The target can decide to roll twice on any saving throw against disease or poison and take the higher result by reducing the spell&rsquo;s total remaining duration by 1 hour.
<tr>
	<th>	Winter:
	<td>	A flutter of snow and crisp air surrounds the target. While this spell remains in effect, the target automatically succeeds at Acrobatics skill checks made to avoid falling while moving across slick or narrow surfaces. The target can move freely through difficult terrain for 1 round by reducing the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration by 1 hour. Difficult terrain created by magic affects the target normally.

With a touch, you enchant a shield and enable it to protect its wielder from hostile spells. The shield grants spell resistance 10 + your caster level against spells so long as the shield can be interposed between the wielder and the spell effect. A <i>ward shield</i> does not provide spell resistance against area effect spells such as <i>fireball</i>, but does provide a +5 bonus on Reflex saving throws against such spells.

The focus of this spell flies upward above your head and takes a defensive position within your space. It lunges at opponents, as if guided by a martially trained hand, parrying and turning back melee attacks aimed at you, but does not strike back at any opponent nor does it damage them. The weapon serves only as a defense. While it protects you, you can cast spells without provoking attacks of opportunity, without the need to cast them defensively.
</p>

<p>
A creature with the Disruptive feat can easily bypass this spell&rsquo;s defenses. You provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells against these creatures even when subject to this spell, though you can still choose to cast defensively.

This spell surrounds you in a spout of clear acid that aids in deflecting attacks and damages creatures that attack you in melee. The constantly upward-rushing waters grant you a measure of protecting, shielding you so you only take half damage from acid and fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.

This spell renders a touched object waterproof for the duration of the spell. The object must be no larger than 10 pounds per caster level. The spell protects the object from any mundane liquids (such as alcohol or oil) but not from magically created liquids. If this spell is cast on a creature, all of that creature&rsquo;s equipment is rendered waterproof as long as it is carried by the target creature.

<p>
This spell generates what appears to be clear, pure water, but it is in fact a foul secretion known as the <i>waters of Lamashtu</i>. The liquid functions in all the same ways as unholy water (see <i>curse water</i>). In addition, any creature that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must attempt a Fortitude save (drinking the <i>waters of Lamashtu</i> is particularly effective&mdash;a creature that drinks the liquid takes a &minus;4 penalty on its save to resist its effects). Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim&rsquo;s mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subject&rsquo;s Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2 ounces of the <i>waters of Lamashtu</i>&mdash;enough for one dose or, if bottled, one use as a thrown weapon.
</p>

<p>
The fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the <i>waters of Lamashtu</i> (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GM&rsquo;s discretion (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim).

You transform into a wave of frothing water up to 15 feet wide and 15 feet tall, as space permits, and then surge forth in a straight line in the direction of your choice, moving up to twice your base movement speed before immediately returning to your normal form. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. While in wave form, you are immune to weapon attacks and attacks that target a specific number of creatures (since the spell is instantaneous, this is mainly relevant for readied actions and the like). All creatures and unattended objects in your path take 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A successful Reflex save prevents a creature from being knocked prone.

You cause torrents of roiling blood to push your opponents away from you. This wave attempts a bull rush combat maneuver against all creatures within its area of effect, and you bull rush creatures of any size in this way. Attempt a single combat maneuver check and apply the result to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Any creature in the area must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for 1d6 rounds by the tide of blood.

The area covered by the cone remains slick for 1 round, requiring a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check from any creature attempting to move within it (as if moving on uneven ground).

<p>
When you cast this spell on a weapon, you cause a portion of the weapon to open like the skin of a partially peeled apple, revealing a space large enough to insert a single wand within.
</p>

<p>
As part of the spell&rsquo;s casting, you can insert a single wand into the weapon, at which point the weapon returns to its original form with the wand held inside of it without negatively impacting the weapon&rsquo;s integrity. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, a character who wields the transmuted weapon is also considered to be wielding the wand as well. You can attack normally with the weapon or use the weapon as if it were the encased wand. If the effect created by the wand requires an attack roll to successfully strike a foe, you may make the attack roll as if you were making an attack with the weapon at its highest bonus (including any bonuses the weapon would normally receive) rather than just a normal attack with the wand&mdash;doing so does not allow you to add the weapon&rsquo;s damage to the wand&rsquo;s attack roll, but instead allows you to use your skill with the weapon to boost your chance of hitting with the spell.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, the encased wand is ejected from the weapon. If you have a free hand, you may catch the weapon as a free action; otherwise, the wand drops to the ground. If the weapon housing the wand is broken or destroyed during the duration of <i>weaponwand</i>, the encased wand is similarly broken or destroyed.

<i>Web</i> creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn&rsquo;t cause you to become grappled.
</p

<p>
Anyone in the effect&rsquo;s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell&rsquo;s DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter.
</p>

<p>
If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.
</p>

<p>
The strands of a web spell are flammable. A flaming weapon can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
</p>

<p>
<i>Web</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

You create a cloud of flame-resistant strands of adhesive webbing that billows and flows much like a <i><a href="#Cloudkill">cloudkill</a></i> spell. The cloud moves away from you at a rate of 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.
</p>

<p>
Figure out the cloud&rsquo;s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where the caster cast the spell. Creatures trapped in the webbing remain trapped even after the cloud passes, but the area the cloud leaves behind does not count as difficult terrain.
</p>

<p>
Because the webbing is heavier than air, it sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. The cloud of webbing cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.
</p>

<p>
The cloud otherwise acts like a <i><a href="#Web">web</a></i> spell. A creature in the cloud at the start of its turn must save against the cloud or be affected. The webbing of this spell is flammable (see the <i>web</i> spell), but has fire resistance 5.

You create a shelter of slightly sticky webbing. The shelter has a hinged door large enough to accommodate a Medium creature. The opaque walls of the shelter measure 1 inch thick and provide total cover to anyone within it.
</p>

<p>
Only Fine creatures with negligible Strength can be caught in the webbing (including swarms); all other creatures can pull themselves free without making a Strength check or taking an action. The webbing is sticky enough to hold twigs, leaves, dirt, and other light items, allowing you to conceal the shelter. The shelter is watertight and insulated when the door is closed. Its surface has a hardness of 0 and 2 hit points for every 5-foot square of web surface area. It takes normal damage from fire and burns as easily as wood. When the spell ends, the webbing decays rapidly and disappears.

By speaking the name &ldquo;Xhamen-Dor,&rdquo; you infuse yourself with the essence of the Inmost Blot and gain a +3 profane bonus on Will saving throws for the spell&rsquo;s duration. When you prepare <i>what grows within</i> for the first time, or the first time you use it via a spell-completion or spell-trigger item, you can thereafter be targeted by Xhamen-Dor&rsquo;s infected dreams ability. As long as you are under the effects of <i>what grows within</i>, your mind-affecting spells carry this supernatural taint within them and can infect those who succumb to those effects. Whenever you successfully affect a creature with one of your mind-affecting spells (this requires the target to fail its saving throw against the spell if the spell allows a save, but automatically affects a target if the spell does not allow a saving throw), that target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against <i>what grows within</i> or it immediately becomes afflicted by a lesser version of Xhamen-Dor&rsquo;s seeded infestation. This infestation does not expose the victim to Xhamen-Dor&rsquo;s infectious dreams, but it can ultimately result in that creature&rsquo;s transformation into one of the seeded. Each time you affect a creature with <i>what grows within</i> in this manner, the remaining duration of <i>what grows within</i> is reduced by 1 round. If you affect multiple creatures in a round, you choose the order in which they must save against the effects of <i>what grows within</i>, and reduce the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration by 1 round each time one of them is affected by the infestation.
</p>

<p>
Lesser Seeded Infestation&mdash;<i>save</i> Fortitude DC = spell&rsquo;s save DC; <i>onset</i> immediate; <i>frequency</i> 1/day; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Constitution drain; <i>cure</i> none. This infestation can be cured by magic alone. A creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 by this infestation dies and rises from death in 1d4 rounds as a seeded creature. This is an infestation effect.

You summon hundreds of Diminutive spiders, which cling together in the form of a whip made for a creature of your size. You can wield this object as if it were an actual whip, except you make a melee touch attack with it instead of a regular attack. Any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a spider swarm (1d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction). The swarm whip is able to damage creatures with armor or natural armor, even if a normal whip could not. It cannot be used to make bull rush, grapple, or trip attacks, and (unlike a swarm) is subject to a miss chance for concealment and cover.
</p>

<p>
The whip is immune to all weapon damage, is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage, and is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). The whip takes half again as much damage from spells or effects that affect an area, but since it is considered part of your gear, it takes damage only if you fail a saving throw on a 1 or if it is specifically targeted by an opponent. The whip does not have a swarm&rsquo;s susceptibility to high winds.
</p>

<p>
As a standard action, you can transform the whip into a spider swarm (all squares of the swarm must be within 15 feet of you); thereafter it functions as <i><a href="#Summon Swarm">summon swarm</a></i>. The spider swarm has 3 hit points and persists in that form for 2 rounds or until the end of this spell&rsquo;s duration, whichever comes first.

This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone&rsquo;s every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone&rsquo;s movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell&rsquo;s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can&rsquo;t regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.) Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The <i>whispering wind</i> travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A <i>whispering wind</i> is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
</p>

<p>
You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the <i>whispering wind</i> seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the <i>whispering wind</i> to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.
</p>

When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, <i>whispering wind</i> cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

Heavy undergrowth gains a +2 bonus to its CMD. Undergrowth cannot move the grapple or pin a foe, but it can deal an amount of damage equal to 1d4 points + your Wisdom modifier by making a successful grapple check against a foe it is grappling. The undergrowth&rsquo;s CMD is 5 + its CMB. If you fail to direct the undergrowth to maintain the grapple, it releases its opponent.

You harden the air around the target into jagged invisible blades that deal damage based on how fast the target moves. On its turn, the target takes 1d6 points of slashing damage if it moves at least 5 feet, plus 1d6 points of slashing damage for each additional 10 feet of movement. Movement that doesn&rsquo;t pass through air (such as burrowing, swimming, or teleportation) doesn&rsquo;t cause this damage.
</p>

<p>
In areas of strong wind, the target takes damage on its turn, even if it doesn&rsquo;t move. The wind deals 1d8 points of slashing damage for strong wind, plus 1d8 for every wind category above strong. This extra damage does not occur from instantaneous wind effects (such as <i>gust of wind</i>), only from wind effects that last at least 1 round.

You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the <i><a href="#Gaseous Form">gaseous form</a></i> spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
</p>

<p>
Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
</p>

<p>
A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
</p>

<p>
For the last minute of the spell&rsquo;s duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a <i>wind wall.</i> Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).
</p>

<p>
While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square <i>wind walls</i> to enclose specific points.

<p>
You surround yourself with a buffeting shroud of supernatural, tornado-force winds. These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. Neither your armor nor your load affects this fly speed. The winds shield you from any other wind effects, and form a shell of breathable air around you, allowing you to fly and breathe underwater or in outer space.
</p>

<p>
Ranged weapons (including giant-thrown boulders, siege weapon projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons) passing through the winds are deflected by the winds and automatically miss you. Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the winds.
</p>

<p>
In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can shape your winds so they lash out at that creature as an immediate action. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw or take 5d8 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (if on the ground). On a failed save, Huge flying creatures are checked and Large-sized or smaller flying creatures are blown away instead of knocked prone.
</p>

<p>
On a successful save, the damage is halved and the creature is not knocked prone (or checked or blown away).

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
<i>Wish is</i> the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even <i>wish</i>, however, has its limits. A <i>wish</i> can produce any one of the following effects.
<ul>
	<li>	Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
	<li>	Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
	<li>	Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
	<li>	Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
	<li>	Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as <i>geas/ quest</i> or <i>insanity.</i>
	<li>	Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <i>wish</i> spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two <i>wishes</i> for a +2 inherent bonus, three <i>wishes </i>for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. <i>Note:</i> An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.
	<li>	Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>wish</i> can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <i>wish</i>.
	<li>	Revive the dead. A <i>wish</i> can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a <i>resurrection</i> spell. A <i>wish</i> can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two <i>wish</i>es: one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A <i>wish</i> cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from gaining a permanent negative level.
	<li>	Transport travelers. A <i>wish</i> can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
	<li>	Undo misfortune. A <i>wish</i> can undo a single recent event. The <i>wish</i> forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <i>wish</i> could undo an opponent&rsquo;s successful save, a foe&rsquo;s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend&rsquo;s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You may try to use a <i>wish</i> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The <i>wish</i> may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.) Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).
</p>

<p>
When a <i>wish</i> duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell).

Created by Ghorus as a safety measure to limit his enemies&rsquo; movements, this spell allows you to inscribe a powerful rune on any surface. <i>Woodland rune</i> triggers when any non-plant creature (apart from the caster) moves within 30 feet of the rune. When it&rsquo;s triggered, roots and branches sprout from the ground, catching all creatures within a 30-foot burst of the rune and hindering their movement as if they were moving through heavy undergrowth, though it does not provide concealment. Plant creatures and creatures under the effect of <i>woodland stride</i> or <i>freedom of movement</i> are not affected by this spell. In all other respects, this spell functions as <i><a href="#Symbol of Death">symbol of death</a></i>.

The subject must speak the command word within 1 round of knowing it to summon you, although the subject isn&rsquo;t obligated to speak it. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

<p>
Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the <i>word of chaos</i> or not. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a &minus;4 penalty) to negate.

<p>
You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave&rsquo;s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.
</p>

<p>
When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).
</p>

<p>
The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.
</p>

<p>
The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave&rsquo;s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.
</p>

<p>
The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).
</p>

<p>
You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.

<p>
The daggers serving as focus of this spell take on a deadly sharpness as they animate and spin around you, creating a 5-foot-radius emanation of spinning mithral blades that moves with you. Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the <i><a href="#Warding Weapon">warding weapon</a></i> spell. While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four <i>+1 frost mithral daggers</i> as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice. No matter the modifications made to the focus weapons, they must always be mithral daggers. No other type of weapons can serve as a focus for this spell.

This spell functions as per <i><a href="#Symbol of Death">symbol of death</a></i>, save that creatures that succumb to this spell become dominated (as per <i>dominate monster</i>) by Hastur. This causes such creatures to seek to aid any obvious minions or worshipers of Hastur in sight, and any true worshiper of Hastur can command the affected creatures as if that worshiper had been the one to dominate them. In the case of conflicting commands issued from different true worshipers of Hastur, the commanders must attempt opposed Charisma checks, with the winner being able to command the targets for that round. If no worshipers or agents of Hastur are in sight, an affected creature can act normally. When affected by this spell&rsquo;s <i>Yellow sign</i> in this way, the effects last for 1 round per level. Once triggered, the <i>Yellow sign</i> remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
</p>

<p>
There is a 1% chance when a creature fails its saving throw against this spell that Hastur takes note and, for reasons of his own, decides to control the target personally. In this case, the actions taken by the dominated creature are left to the GM to determine, but the effects of this spell&rsquo;s <i>Yellow sign</i> persist for 1 day per level and the commands issued cannot be countermanded by any other creature, even if they are Hastur worshipers.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of how long the effects last or whether Hastur directly controls a victim, if a creature failed to resist this spell&rsquo;s effects, Hastur can target that victim for the rest of its life with his fulvous dreams ability. Whether or not the Great Old One ever chooses to do so is left to the GM to determine.
</p>

<p>
<i>Yellow sign</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 18th level or higher for the cost of 40,000 gp.

The twisted druids of the Uskwood forsook fire in ages past for the glory of Zon-Kuthon. Despite this aversion, these servants of Nidal know well the sting of flame, and have learned to turn it back on those that wield it. This spell creates a zone where magical fire effects twist and lash out against those who create the effects. A <i>zone of foul flames</i> looks unremarkable to the casual observer, but a Perception check (DC = 20 + the caster&rsquo;s level) reveals a faint rippling effect in the area, as if of heat distortions in the air.
</p>

<p>
Whenever a creature casts a spell with the fire descriptor or activates a magical fire effect (as from a magic item or a special attack) while that creature is located in a <i>zone of foul flames</i>, that creature takes full fire damage from the effect.
</p>

<p>
If the effect allows a saving throw to reduce the damage, the victim may attempt the same saving throw to reduce the damage. All creatures in a <i>zone of foul flames</i> gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against fire effects, except for those made by a creature attempting to save against fire damage from his own magic. Nonmagical fire in a <i>zone of foul flames</i> burns half as brightly but is otherwise not affected.

By casting <i>zone of silence</i>, you manipulate sound waves in your immediate vicinity so that you and those within the spell&rsquo;s area can converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices or any other noises from within, including language-dependent or sonic spell effects. This effect is centered on you and moves with you.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful DC 20 Linguistics check to read lips can still reveal what&rsquo;s said inside a <i>zone of silence</i>.

<p>
Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can&rsquo;t speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.
