<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<h2 class=top>Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="PowerAttack">	Power Attack</dt>
	<dd>			You can take a &minus;3 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +6 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased to +9 if you are attacking with a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon using two hands, and is halved to +3 if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon.  You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.</dd>

	<dt id="Trip">		Trip (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>			Tim can attempt to trip its opponent as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity if he hits with his bite.  If the attempt fails, he is not tripped in return.</dd>
</dl>


<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="Devotion">	Devotion (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>			Tim gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</dd>

	<dt id="Evasion">	 Evasion (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>			If Tim is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, he takes no damage if he makes a successful saving throw.</dd>

	<dt id="Link">		Link (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>			Glim can handle Tim as a free action, or push him as a move action. He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all Handle Animal checks made regarding Tim.</dd>

	<dt id="Multiattack">	Multiattack</dt>
	<dd>			Tim gains a second attack with his bite, albeit at a &minus;5 penalty. </dd>

	<dt id="ShareSpells">	Share Spells (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>			Glim may cast a spell with a target of &ldquo;You&rdquo; on Tim (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on himself. He may cast spells on Tim even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of Tim&rsquo;s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come from the oracle class.  This ability does not allow Tim to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.</dd>

	<dt id="Tricks">	Tricks</dt>
	<dd>			Glim can make a DC 10 Handle Animal check as a free action to command Tim to perform any trick he knows.  Alternatively, Glim can make a DC 25 Handle Animal check as a move action to command Tim to perform a trick he doesn&rsquo;t know but is physically capable of performing.  In either case, the DC is increased by 2 if Tim is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage.  Tim knows the following tricks:
				<dl class="Options">
					<dt id="Attack">	Attack</dt>
					<dd>			Tim attacks apparent enemies. Glim may point to a particular creature that he wishes Tim to attack, and he will comply if able.</dd>
				
					<dt id="Come">		Come</dt>
					<dd>			Tim comes to Glim, even if it normally would not do so.</dd>
					
					<dt id="Defend">	Defend</dt>
					<dd>			Tim defends Glim (or is ready to defend Glim if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, Glim can command Tim to defend another specific character.</dd>
				
					<dt id="Down">		Down</dt>
					<dd>			Tim breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down.</dd>
				
					<dt id="Flank">		Flank</dt>
					<dd>			Glim can instruct Tim to attack a foe he point to and always attempt to be adjacent to (and threatening) that foe. If Glim or an ally is also threatening the foe, Tim attempts to flank the foe, if possible. Tim always takes attacks of opportunity. </dd>
				
					<dt id="Guard">		Guard</dt>
					<dd>			Tim stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</dd>
				
					<dt id="Heel">		Heel</dt>
					<dd>			Tim follows Glim closely, even to places where he normally wouldnâ€™t go.</dd>
				
					<dt id="Maneuver">	Maneuver</dt>
					<dd>			Tim uses the trip combat maneuver on command.</dd>
				
					<dt id="Track">		Track</dt>
					<dd>			Tim tracks the scent presented to him.</dd>
				
					<dt id="Watch">		Watch</dt>
					<dd>			Tim can be commanded to keep watch over a particular area, such as a campsite, and raise an alarm if he notices any sizable or dangerous creature entering the area.</dd>
