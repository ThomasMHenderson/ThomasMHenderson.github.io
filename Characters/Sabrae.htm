<h1>Bardic Performance & Battle Dance</h1>
<hr class="big">
You can use performances to create magical effects on those around you, including yourself if desired; alternatively, you can use dances to create magical effects on yourself.  You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + your Charisma modifier, plus an additional 2 rounds per day for each bard level after 1st.  Each round, you can produce any one of bardic performances or battle dances that you have mastered.  Starting a bardic performance is a move action, while starting a battle dance is a move or swift action; each can be maintained as a free action.  Changing a performance from one effect to another requires you to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a move action; similarly, changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires you to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move or swift action.  A performance cannot be disrupted, but ends immediately if you are killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. You cannot have more than one bardic performance ot battle dance in effect at one time.

<p>
If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear you for the performance to have any effect, and such performances are language dependent. If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to you for the performance to have any effect.  A deaf bard has a 20% change to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component, and a blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with visual components. If you fail this check, the attempt still counts against your daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components, and blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.  You do not need to be able to see or hear your own battle dance.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Your available bardic performances are:
<dl>
	<dt id="Countersong">		Countersong (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You may make a Perform (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check.  Any creature within 30 feet (including you) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher.  If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the Perform skill check result for the save.  Countersong does not work on effects that don&rsquo;t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.</dd>

	<dt id="Distraction">		Distraction (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You may make a Perform (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet (including you) that is affected by an illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack may use the Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the distraction is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it sees the distraction, but it must use the Perform check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don&rsquo;t allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.</dd>

	<dt id="Fascinate">		Fascinate (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You may use performance to cause one creature to become fascinated with you.  The target must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear you, and capable of paying attention to you, and you must be able to see the target. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working.

<p>
The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + &frac12; your bard level + your Cha modifier) to negate the effect.  If the saving throw succeeds, you cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours.  If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as you continues to maintain it.  While fascinated, a target takes a &minus;4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks.  Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect.  Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt">
Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.
</p>

	<dt id="InspireCompetence">	Inspire Competence (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use performance to help an ally succeed at a task. That ally must be within 30 feet and be able to hear you. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear your performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels you have attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th). Certain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as Stealth, and may be disallowed at the GM&rsquo;s discretion. You can&rsquo;t inspire competence in yourself. Inspire competence relies on audible components.</dd>
</dl>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Your available battle dances are:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt id="InspireCourage">	Inspire Courage (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You use dance to inspire courage in yourself. You receive a +3 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +3 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. Inspire courage can use audible or visual components. You must choose which component to use when starting the performance.</dd>
	
	<dt id="RainOfBlows">		Rain of Blows (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use your battle dance to speed up your attacks. When making a full attack action, you may make one extra attack with any weapon you are holding, as though under the effects of a <a href="Spellbook.htm#Haste"><i>haste</i></a> spell. You also gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. At 9th level, and every three bard levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These bonuses do not stack with the <i>haste</i> spell.</dd>

	<dt id="RazorsKiss">		Razor&rsquo;s Kiss (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use your battle dance to improve your weapons&rsquo; critical range. All attacks you make with manufactured weapons are treated as though you had the Improved Critical feat. Natural weapons and spells are not affected.</dd>
	
	<dt id="InspireGreatness">	Inspire Greatness (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use performance to inspire greatness in yourself, granting extra fighting capability. You gain 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply your Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.</dd>
</dl>




<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="Deeds">			Deeds</dt>
	<dd>				You can spend <a href="#Panache">panache</a> points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant you a momentary bonus or effect, but some provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds remain in effect while you at least 1 panache point, but do not require expending panache to be maintained. You can only perform deeds of your level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as you have or spend the required number of panache points to perform the deed.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Available deeds include:
		<dl class="options">
			<dt id="Derring-Do">			Derring-Do (Ex)</dt>
			<dd>					You can spend 1 panache point when you make an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check.  You can do this after you make the check but before the result is revealed.  If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, you can roll another 1d6 and add it to the check, and can continue to do this as long as you roll natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier.</dd>

			<dt id="DodgingPanache">		Dodging Panache (Ex)</dt>
			<dd>					When an opponent attempts a melee attack against you, can spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet as an immediate action, granting you a dodge bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier against the triggering attack.  The movement does not negate the attack, which is resolved as if you had not moved from the original square.  This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed.  You can only perform this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.</dd>

			<dt id="KipUp">				Kip Up (Ex)</dt>
			<dd>					While you have at least 1 panache point, you can kip-up from prone as a move action without provoking an attack of opportunity. You can kip-up as a swift action instead by spending 1 panache point.</dd>

			<dt id="MenacingSwordplay">		Menacing Swordplay (Ex)</dt>
			<dd>					While you at least 1 panache point, when you hit an opponent with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, you can choose to use Intimidate to demoralize that opponent as a swift action instead of a standard action.</dd>

			<dt id="ParryRiposte">			Opportune Parry and Riposte (Ex)</dt>
			<dd>					When an opponent makes a melee attack against you, you can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack.  You make an attack roll as if making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attack creature is larger than you, you take a &minus;2 penalty on this roll.  If your result is greater than the attacking creature&rsquo;s result, the creature&rsquo;s attack automatically misses.  You must declare the use of this ability after the creature&rsquo;s attack is announced but before its attack roll is made.  Upon performing a successful parry, you can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack you parried, provided that creature is within your reach and that you have at least 1 panache point.</dd>

			<dt id="PreciseStrike">			Precise Strike (Ex)</dt>
			<dd>					While you have at least 1 panache point, you gain the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon (though not natural weapon attacks), adding your swashbuckler level to the damage dealt.  To use this deed, you cannot attack with a weapon in your other hand or use a shield other than a buckler.  You can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of you.  Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike.  This additional damage is precision damage, and isn&rsquo;t multiplied on a critical hit.  As a swift action, you can spend 1 panache point to double your precise strike&rsquo;s damage bonus on the next attack. This benefit must be used before the end of your turn, or it is lost.</dd>

			<dt id="SwashbucklerInitiative">	Swashbuckler Initiative (Ex)</dt>
			<dd>					While you have at least 1 panache point, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, if you have the Quick Draw feat, your hands are free and unrestrained, and you have any single light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that isn&rsquo;t hidden, you can draw that weapon as part of the initiative check.</dd>
		</dl>
</p></dd>

	<dt id="DervishDance">		Dervish Dance</dt>
	<dd>				You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on melee damage rolls when using your dervish finesse. You count as having the Dervish Dance feat for purposes of meeting feat prerequisites.</dd>

	<dt id="DervishFinesse">	Dervish Finesse (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You gain the benefits of the Weapon Finesse feat with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, and can use your Charisma score in place of Intelligence as a prerequisite for combat feats. This ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for purposes of meeting feat prerequisites.  You can treat a scimitar as a one-handed piercing melee weapon for the purposes of all feats and class abilities that refer to such a weapon.</dd>

	<dt id="Fleet">			Fleet (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				While performing a battle dance, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your land speed. This bonus increases by 5 feet for every four bard levels gained after 1st level, to a maximum of +30 feet at 17th level.</dd>

	<dt id="JackOfAllTrades">	Jack of All Trades (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You can use any skill, even if the skill normally requires you to be trained.</dd>
	
	<dt id="LightBlindness">	Light Blindness</dt>
	<dd>				Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds you for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, you are dazzled as long as you remain in the affected area.  (A dazzled creature takes a &minus;1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks.)</dd>

	<dt id="Nimble">		Nimble (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes you to lose your Dexterity bonus to AC also causes you to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level).</dd>

	<dt id="Panache">		Panache (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				At the start of each day, you gain a number of panache points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) which you can spend to accomplish <a href="#Deeds">deeds</a>.  You can regain panache point in three ways, although your panache cannot go higher than its starting value:
<ol>
	<li>	Every time you confirm a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, you regain one panache point.</li>
	<li>	You regain one panache point every time you reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon attack while in combat, if the foe is an evil undead or outsider, or the damage done is nonlethal.  Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level to 0 or fewer hit points doesn&rsquo;t restore any panache.</li>
	<li>	You also gain one panache point if you cause an evildoer with a number of Hit Dice equal to at least half your character level to surrender to you.  You can gain this benefit no more than once per round, even if multiple enemies surrender.</li>
</ol></dd>

	<dt id="PoisonUse">		Poison Use (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning yourself.</dd>

	<dt id="SpellResistance">	Spell Resistance</dt>
	<dd>				To affect you with a spell or spell-like ability which does not ignore spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a caster level check at least equal to your spell resistance.  If the check fails, the spell doesn&rsquo;t affect you.  You need not do anything to use spell resistance, nor need you be aware of the threat for spell resistance to operate.  You can voluntarily lower you spell resistance as a standard action which does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  Once lowered, it remains down until the start of your next turn, when it automatically returns.  Spell resistance is checked only once per spell, and is checked when you are first affected by the spell.  It can protect you from a spell that has already been cast.  If you lower your resistance and are then subjected to a spell, you have a single chance to resist the spell later, when your spell resistance is back up.  Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell actually goes to work on your mind or body.  If the spell acts on anything else and you are affected as a consequence, no roll is required.</dd>

	<dt id="VersatileDance">	Versatile Dance (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a bonus equal to half your bard level on Perform (dance) checks.  This bonus is already included above.  You can use your bonus for your Perform (dance) skill in place of your bonus for Acrobatics.</dd>

	<dt id="WellVersed">		Well-Versed (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, sonic, and language-dependent effects.</dd>
</dl>



<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="Acid">			Acid</dt>
	<dd>				You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.</dd>

	<dt id="Bow">			<i>Adaptive +1 Training (Deadly Aim) Composite Shortbow</i></dt>
	<dd>				This composite shortbow has a +1 enhancement bonus.  Additionally, the bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder&rsquo;s Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired.  The bow also grants the Deadly Aim feat to the wielder as long as the weapon is drawn and in hand. That feat cannot be used as a prerequisite for any other feats and functions only if the wielder meets its prerequisites. Once chosen, the feat stored in the weapon cannot be changed.</dd>

	<dt id="Armor">			Celestial Armor of Comfort</dt>
	<dd>				This <i>+3 chainmail</i> is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of &minus;1, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor and allows the wearer to use <a href="Spellbook.htm#Fly" target=""_blank""><i>fly</i></a> on command once per day.  The armor sheds dirt and sweat as they accumulate, and remains as comfortable as weather-appropriate clothing regardless of environmental conditions.  It always looks immaculately clean, and does not cause a penalty to the wearer&rsquo;s saving throws to resist the effects of extreme heat. In cold weather, it counts as cold-weather clothing.</dd>

	<dt id="CircletPersuasion">	<i>Circlet of Persuasion</i></dt>
	<dd>				This delicately engraved silver headband grants its wearer a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks.</dd>

	<dt id="CovenantRing">		Covenant Ring</dt>
	<dd>				When Sabrae and Sonya each wear one of these silver rings, each gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear effects.  This bonus ends if their emotional bond is severed, or if one of them is not wearing the ring.</dd>

	<dt id="Cyltherian">		<i>Cyltherian</i></dt>
	<dd>				This <i>+5 sabre</i> is made of adamantine and ignores hardness less than 20 when sundering weapons or attacking objects.  It has hardness 30 and 57 hit points.</dd>

	<dt id="FourLeafClover">	<i>Four-leaf Clover</i></dt>
	<dd>				A creature with a <i>four-leaf clover</i> in her possession can call upon an extra boost of luck before attempting a single ability check, saving throw, or skill check. She gains a +2 luck bonus on that check. This ability functions three times per day, and requires a free action that the owner can perform even when it&rsquo;s not her turn.</dd>

	<dt id="HandyHaversack">	<i>Handy Haversack</i></dt>
	<dd>				A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.</dd>

	<dt id="IounTorch">		<i>Ioun Torch</i></dt>
	<dd>				This item is merely a burned out, dull gray sphere <i>ioun stone</i> with a <i>continual flame</i> spell cast upon it. It retains the ability to float and orbit, and allows Sabrae to carry light and still have her hands free.</dd>

	<dt id="Page">			<i>Page of Spell Knowledge</i></dt>
	<dd>				This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known.</dd>

	<dt id="RingofSpellKnowledge">	<i>Ring of Spell Knowledge</i></dt>
	<dd>				Through study, the wearer of this ring can gain the knowledge of a single 1st -or 2nd-level spell in addition to those allotted by her class and level. The wearer must still encounter a written, active, or cast version of the spell and succeed at a DC 20 Spellcraft check to teach the spell to the ring. Thereafter, the arcane spellcaster may cast the spell as though she knew the spell and it appeared on her class spell list.  Arcane spells that do not appear on the wearer&rsquo;s class list are treated as one level higher for all purposes (storage and casting). Currently, the ring stores <i>shield.</i></dd>

	<dt id="Amulet">		<i>Sabrae&rsquo;s Amulet</i></dt>
	<dd>				This amulet functions as an <i>amulet of natural armor +3</i> and provides a +3 enhancement bonus to the wearer&rsquo;s natural bonus to Armor Class.  Additionally, it functions as a <i>swarmbane clasp</i>.  The wearer&rsquo;s weapons, unarmed attacks, and natural attacks deal full damage to swarms, regardless of the swarm&rsquo;s immunity to weapon damage (if any, although damage reduction applies as normal). If the wearer is damaged by a swarm, she automatically succeeds on her saving throw against the swarm&rsquo;s distraction ability. </dd>

	<dt id="SabraesBelt">		<i>Sabrae&rsquo;s Belt</i></dt>
	<dd>				This belt provides a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution.</dd>

	<dt id="Cloak">			<i>Sabrae&rsquo;s Cloak</i></dt>
	<dd>				This cloak combines the benefits of a <i>cloak of resistance +5</i> with <i>muleback cords</i>; the latter benefit means that Sabrae treats her Strength score as 8 higher than normal when determining her carrying capacity.</dd>

	<dt id="Sleeves">		<i>Sleeves of Many Garments</i></dt>
	<dd>				These translucent cloth tubes easily fit over their wearer&rsquo;s arms. The wearer of these sleeves can, when she slips them on, choose to transform the appearance of her current garments into any other nonmagical set of clothing. These new clothes fit her perfectly and are always clean and mended unless she specifically designates otherwise. When she removes the sleeves, her clothes revert to their original form.</dd>
