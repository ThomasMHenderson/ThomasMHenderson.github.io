<h4>Personality Profile</h4>






<h4>Background</h4>
Born into a family of barbarians), son of one of the tribal elders and his mistress, who was one of the &ldquo;witches&rdquo; (i.e. sorceress) of the tribe. During his prepubescent years he realized he was different, quick to anger and becoming bound with seemingly giant-like strength, he also noticed he did not exhibit the same signs of rage as the other barbarians in his tribe. After seeking guidance from his mother, she revealed to him that he was likely a blood rager, and linked to their great ancestor (<i>name of dragon later</i>), an ancient copper dragon. Fearing becoming an outcast for being different Caivre left soon after hitting his 15th birthday. Upon this time, while out performing a quest for &ldquo;manhood&rdquo; the anger came upon him and his hands transformed, Caivre was embued with the powers of the dragons! Learning to embrace this, he moved about, finally ending here and the tale continues&hellip;
