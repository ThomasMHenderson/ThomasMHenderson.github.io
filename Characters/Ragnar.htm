<sup>&Dagger;</sup> You have a +4 bonus to locate traps and a +3 bonus to avoid being surprised by a foe.



<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class=big>
<h2 class=top>Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=SpringAttack>		Spring Attack
	<dd>				As a full round action, you can move up to your speed and make a single melee attack without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your attack. You can move both before and after the attack, but you must move at least 10 feet before the attack and the total distance that you move cannot be greater than your speed. You cannot use this ability to attack a foe that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn.
</dl>


<h2>Passive Abilities</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=BlendedView>		Blended View
	<dd>				You gain darkvision to a distance of 60 feet.

	<dt id=DangerSense>		Danger Sense (Ex)
	<dd>				You gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps, a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps, and a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).

	<dt id=Darkvision>		Darkvision
	<dd>				You can see in total darkness, out to a range of 60 feet.  Within this range, you can see as clearly as a sighted creature could see in an area of bright light. Darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal sight.  It does not allow you to see anything that youcould not see otherwise&mdash;invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects you to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.

	<dt id=DivinePurpose>		Divine Purpose (Su)
	<dd>				You gain a +1 sacred bonus on Fortitude and Will saving throws.

	<dt id=Dodge>			Dodge
	<dd>				You gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. A condition that makes you lose your Dex bonus to AC also makes you lose the benefits of this feat.

	<dt id=ElvenImmunities>		Elven Immunities
	<dd>				You are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.

	<dt id=EternalGrudge>		Eternal Grudge
	<dd>				You receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoids of the dwarf and orc subtypes.

	<dt id=Evasion>			Evasion (Ex)
	<dd>				If you succeed at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor.  You do not gain the benefit of evasion while you are helpless.

	<dt id=LedgeWalker>		Ledge Walker (Ex)
	<dd>				You can move along narrow, uneven, or slippery surfaces (such as ice) at full speed using the Acrobatics skill without penalty. In addition, you are not flat-footed when using Acrobatics to move along such surfaces, and retain your Dexterity bonus to AC.

	<dt id=LowLightVision>		Low-Light Vision
	<dd>				You can see twice as far as normal in dim light and can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as you can during the day.  Low-light vision is color vision. 

	<dt id=Mobility>		Mobility
	<dd>				You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

	<dt id=NimbleMoves>		Nimble Moves
	<dd>				Whenever you move, you may move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. This feat allows you to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain.

	<dt id=Reactionary>		Reactionary
	<dd>				You gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks.

	<dt id=Survivalist>		Survivalist
	<dd>				You add Heal and Survival to your list of class skills.

	<dt id=Trapfinding>		Trapfinding (Ex)
	<dd>				Add &frac12; your rogue level (round down) to Perception checks to locate traps and to Disable Device skill checks. You can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The bonus to Disable Device is already included above.

	<dt id=WeaponFamiliarity>	Weapon Familiarity
	<dd>				You are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, and shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word &ldquo;elven&rdquo; in its name as a martial weapon.

	<dt id=WeaponFinesse>		Weapon Finesse
	<dd>				With a light weapon, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.

	<dt id=WeaponFocus>		Weapon Focus (Short Sword)
	<dd>				You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using a short sword.

	<dt id=WeaponTraining>		Weapon Training
	<dd>				You gain <a href=#WeaponFocus>Weapon Focus</a> as a bonus feat.
</dl>


<h2>Immediate Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=Resiliency>		Resiliency (Ex)
	<dd>				Once per day, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your rogue level. Activating this ability is an immediate action that can be performed only when you are brought to below 0 hit points. This ability can be used to prevent you from dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If your hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit points, you fall unconscious and is dying as normal.
</dl>


<h2>Standard Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=DivineEpiphany>		Divine Epiphany (Su)
	<dd>				Once per day, you can peer into the immediate future and predict the results of a specific action as if you had cast an <a href="Spellbook.htm#Augury" target=_blank><i>augury</i></a> spell.  The caster level of this spell is equal to your sanctified rogue class level. 

	<dt id=MagicalTalent>		Magical Talent (Sp)
	<dd>				You may cast <a href="Spellbook.htm#Unwitting Ally" target=_blank><i>unwitting ally</i></a> once per day as a spell-like ability. This spell-like ability is cast at your highest caster level gained; if you have no caster level, it functions at CL 1st. The spell-like ability&rsquo;s save DC is Charisma-based.
</dl>



<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id=DebilitatingInjury>	Debilitating Injury (Ex)
	<dd>				Whenever you deal <a href=#SneakAttack>sneak attack</a> damage to a foe, you can also debilitate the target of your attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). You can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.

<dl class=options style="margin-bottom:0">
	<dt>	Bewildered
	<dd>	The target becomes bewildered, taking a &minus;2 penalty to AC and an additional &minus;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by you.  At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against your attacks made by the rogue increases by &minus;2 (to a total maximum of &minus;8).

	<dt>	Disoriented
	<dd>	The target takes a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls, and an additional &minus;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against you. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against you increases by &minus;2 (to a total maximum of &minus;8).

	<dt>	Hampered
	<dd>	All of the target&rsquo;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.
</dl>
These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.

	<dt id=ExtraRogueTalent>	Extra Rogue Talent
	<dd>				You gain one additional rogue talent. You must meet all of the prerequisites for this rogue talent.
					<br><b>Special:</b> You can gain Extra Rogue Talent multiple times.

	<dt id=FinesseTraining>		Finesse Training (Ex)
	<dd>				You gain <a href=#WeaponFinesse>Weapon Finesse</a> as a bonus feat.
					In addition, you can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers).
					Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.
					Whenever you make a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, you add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to the damage roll.
					If any effect would prevent you from adding your Strength modifier to the damage roll, you do not add your Dexterity modifier.
					You can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.

	<dt id=RogueTalent>		Rogue Talent
	<dd>				Starting at 2nd level, you gain one rogue talent.  You gain an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level.  You cannot select an individual talent more than once.

	<dt id=RogueEdge>		Rogue&rsquo;s Edge (Ex)
	<dd>				You gain the skill unlock powers for a skill as appropriate for your number of ranks in that skill.  At 10th, 15th, and 20th level, you choose an additional skill and gain skill unlock powers for that skill as well.  You have chosen <a href=#SenseMotive>Sense Motive</a>.

	<dt id=SneakAttack>		Sneak Attack
	<dd>				Whenever you flank your target or it would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC, you do extra damage. If you score a critical hit with a sneak attack, the extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage; you cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack. 
</dl>


<h1>Skill Unlocks</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>
	<dt id=SenseMotive>		Sense Motive
	<dd>				With sufficient ranks in Sense Motive, you earn the following:			
<dl class=options>
	<dt>	5 Ranks
	<dd>	If you were aware of an opponent before rolling initiative (such as when you ambush an enemy or negotiations break down into combat, but not when both sides happen upon each other or you are surprised), you can attempt a Sense Motive check as part of your initiative check (DC = 11 + the highest Bluff modifier among your opponents or DC 15, whichever is higher). If you succeed, you gain a +1 bonus on the initiative check, plus an additional +1 for every 5 by which you exceeded the DC.

	<dt>	10 Ranks
	<dd>	After 1 minute of conversation, you can read a creature&rsquo;s surface thoughts (as <a href="Spellbook.htm#Detect Thoughts" target=_blank><i>detect thoughts</i></a>) by attempting a Sense Motive check at a &minus;20 penalty opposed by the creature’s Bluff check.

	<dt>	15 Ranks
	<dd>	You can read surface thoughts as above after 1 round. In addition, when attacked, you can attempt a Sense Motive check as an immediate action opposed by your target&rsquo;s attack roll. A successful check grants a +2 insight bonus to your AC against attacks from that specific opponent for 1 minute.

	<dt>	20 Ranks
	<dd>	You can read surface thoughts as above as a standard action. A successful check to gain an insight bonus to your AC also negates the attack that triggered it.
</dl>
</dl>

<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>
	<dt id=AlchemicalGrease>	Alchemical Grease
	<dd>				Each pot of this slick black goo has sufficient contents to cover one Medium creature or two Small ones. If you coat yourself in alchemical grease, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on Escape Artist checks, on combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to your CMD to avoid being grappled; this lasts 4 hours or until you wash it off.

	<dt id=Antitoxin>		Antitoxin
	<dd>				If you drink a vial of antitoxin, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.

	<dt id=BagOfHolding>		<i>Bag of Holding (Type II)</i>
	<dd>				This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The <i>bag of holding</i> opens into a nondimensional space which can contain 70 cubic feet.  Regardless of what is put into the bag, up to a maximum weight of 500 pounds, the bag weighs 25 pounds.
	
<p>
If a <i>bag of holding</i> is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a <i>bag of holding</i> is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a <i>bag of holding</i> is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold,in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.

<p>
Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
If a <i>bag of holdingi</i> is placed within a <i>portable hole</i>, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a <i>portable hole</i> is placed within a <i>bag of holding</i>, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the <i>portable hole</i> and <i>bag of holding</i> in the process.

	<dt id=CelestialLamp>		Celestial Lamp
	<dd>				This polished lantern contains a <a href="Spellbook.htm#Continual Flame" target=_blank><i>continual flame</i></a> and sheds light as a common lamp. If its font of consecrated crystal and metalwork is filled with holy water, the lamp&rsquo;s light is sanctified for 24 hours, adding a +1 bonus to the save DC of channeled positive energy or energy channeled to harm evil outsiders within a 30-foot radius.

	<dt id=DrowPoison>		Drow Poison
	<dd>				This is an injury poison.  When injured, a victim must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save; failure means that the victim is unconscious for one minute and must save again after the minute is up; if the victim fails this second save as well, he or she is unconscious for 2d4 hours.

	<dt id=Sword>			<i>Holy Transformative Silversheen Short Sword +1</i>
	<dd>				This <i>+1 short sword </i> is made of silversheen.  As such, it is immune to rust, including that of rust monsters, the <i>rusting grasp</i> spell, and so on, and bypasses damage resistance as if it were alchemical silver.  The weapon is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Upon its wielder&rsquo;s command, as a standard action, the sword alters its shape, becoming any other light melee weapon.  It can also become a one-handed Small melee weapon or a two-handed Tiny melee weapon, both usable by a Medium creature without the &minus;2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size.  The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its shape.  When unattended, the sword reverts to its true shape.

	<dt id=HolyWater>		Holy Water
	<dd>				Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.  Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.

	<dt id=InsomniaPowder>		Insomnia Powder
	<dd>				This is a powerful stimulant that affects the nervous systems of any creatures that inhale or ingest it, preventing them from sleeping for 24 hours. A packet of insomnia powder can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save to avoid the effect, while those in the splash radius must succeed at DC 8 Fortitude saves. This is a poison effect.  Although it causes no severe damage, insomnia can cause a creature to be more prone to fatigue or exhaustion. Though it prevents sleep (and thus prevents wizards and some other spellcasters from regaining their spells), insomnia powder does not prevent a creature from meditating or praying. The effects of insomnia powder can be countered by <i>sleep</i>, <i>neutralize poison</i>, or similar effects.

	<dt id=ItchingPowder>		Itching Powder
	<dd>				This splash weapon causes targets to suffer from uncontrollable itching until they spend at least 1 round washing it off. Throwing a packet of itching powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 10 feet. Anyone standing on the square of impact must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist the powder, while those in adjacent squares must make a DC 8 Fortitude save. Creatures that fail the save take a &minus;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks until they wash the powder off. This is a poison effect. 

	<dt id=Oil>			Oil
	<dd>				A 1-pint flask of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern or lamp.
	
<p>
You can also use a flask of oil as a splash weapon.  Preparing a flask with a fuse is a full round action.  Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.  Throwing the flask is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.  A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a large body of water or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.

You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.

	<dt id=SmellingSalts>		Smelling Salts
	<dd>				Smelling salts grant you a new saving throw to resist any spell or effect that has already rendered you unconscious or staggered. If exposed to smelling salts while dying, you immediately become conscious and staggered, but must still make stabilization checks each round; if you perform any standard action (or any other strenuous action), you take 1 point of damage after completing the act and fall unconscious again. A container of smelling salts has dozens of uses if stoppered after each use, but depletes in a matter of hours if left open.
	
	<dt id=Smokestick>		Smokestick
	<dd>				This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a <a href="Spellbook.htm#Fog Cloud" target=_blank><i>fog cloud</i></a> spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute.

	<dt id=SneezingPowder>		Sneezing Powder
	<dd>				This splash weapon that causes uncontrollable sneezing for 1d4+1 rounds. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist the powder, while those in adjacent squares must make DC 8 Fortitude saves. Creatures affected by sneezing powder must make a DC 10 Fortitude save every round for the duration or be staggered until their next turn. This is a poison effect.

	<dt id=SpiderSac>		Spider Sac
	<dd>				When squeezed, a spider sac&rsquo;s adhesive shoots out to a maximum range of 10 feet and sticks to whatever it strikes, whereupon the strand dries instantly into a durable fibrous rope. For the purposes of climbing, treat a spider sac as a grappling hook except that all surfaces are AC 5. A spider sac can also be used as a lasso except with AC 10, 4 hit points, and a DC 24 Strength check to burst. A spider sac is a single-use item.

	<dt id=Tindertwig>		Tindertwig
	<dd>				The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface (a move action). Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with tinder and a flint and steel or magnifying glass. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action rather than a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action. A tindertwig burns for 1d2 rounds and sheds light as a candle. Tindertwigs are waterproof, but must be dried before you can strike them.

	<dt id=Figurine>		<i>Toy Horse</i>
	<dd>				This toy wooden horse can be transformed into a riding horse, complete with gear, as if casting the <a href="Spellbook.htm#Mount" target=_blank><i>mount</i></a> spell at caster level 1.

<h1>Notes</h1>
<hr class=big>
This sheet is a little overcomplete from what I usually do, but since what you gave me had everything, I put it all here.  If it were me, I would leave off the rules text for things like
<ul style="margin:auto 0pt">
	<li>	Darkvision
	<li>	Dodge
	<li>	Elven Immunities
	<li>	Mobility
	<li>	Reactionary
	<li>	Survivalist
	<li>	Weapon Finesse
	<li>	Weapon Focus
	<li>	Weapon Training
	<li>	Extra Rogue Talent
	<li>	Fleet-Footed
	<li>	Rogue Talent
	<li>	Rogue&rsquo;s Edge
</ul>
The resulting sheet would be a lot more manageable!

<p>
<b>NB:</b> Gear does <i>not</i> list everything you have, just the things I think are most notable.  The gear sheet is complete.
