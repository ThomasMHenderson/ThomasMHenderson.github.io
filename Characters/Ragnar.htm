<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class=big>
<h2 class=top>Free Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=DominoEffect>		Domino Effect
	<dd>				Whenever you successfully deal damage to an opponent with studied strike, as a free action you can apply the effects of studied combat to an opponent adjacent to the first.
</dl>


<h2>Swift Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=ArcaneArmorTraining>	Arcane Armor Training
	<dd>				As a swift action, you can reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to the armor you are wearing by 10% for any spells you cast this round.

	<dt id=StudiedCombat>		Studied Combat (Ex)
	<dd>				You can use a move action or a swift action to study a single enemy that you can see. Upon doing so, you add &frac12; your investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or until you deal damage with a <a href=#StudiedStrike>studied strike</a>, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.  You can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of your studied combat, it cannot become the target of your studied combat again for 24 hours unless you expend one use of <a href=#Inspiration>inspiration</a> when taking the action to use this ability.
</dl>



<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id=ArcaneFocus>		Arcane Focus
	<dd>				You gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks made to cast arcane spells defensively.

	<dt id=BlendedView>		Blended View
	<dd>				You have low-light vision and also gain darkvision to a distance of 60 feet.

	<dt id=Deeds>			Deeds
	<dd>				You can spend <a href=#InspiredPanache>panache</a> points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant you a momentary bonus or effect, but some provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds remain in effect while you at least 1 panache point, but do not require expending panache to be maintained. You can only perform deeds of your level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as you have or spend the required number of panache points to perform the deed.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Available deeds include:
		<dl class=options>
			<dt id=Derring-Do>		Derring-Do (Ex)
			<dd>				You can spend 1 panache point when you make an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check.  You can do this after you make the check but before the result is revealed.  If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, you can roll another 1d6 and add it to the check, and can continue to do this as long as you roll natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier.

			<dt id=DodgingPanache>		Dodging Panache (Ex)
			<dd>				When an opponent attempts a melee attack against you, can spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet as an immediate action, granting you a dodge bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier against the triggering attack.  The movement does not negate the attack, which is resolved as if you had not moved from the original square.  This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed.  You can only perform this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.

			<dt id=ParryRiposte>		Opportune Parry and Riposte (Ex)
			<dd>				When an opponent makes a melee attack against you, you can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack.  You make an attack roll as if making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attack creature is larger than you, you take a &minus;2 penalty on this roll.  If your result is greater than the attacking creature&rsquo;s result, the creature&rsquo;s attack automatically misses.  You must declare the use of this ability after the creature&rsquo;s attack is announced but before its attack roll is made.  Upon performing a successful parry, you can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack you parried, provided that creature is within your reach and that you have at least 1 panache point.
		</dl>

	<dt id=EideticRecollection>	Eidetic Recollection (Su)
	<dd>				You can always choose to take 10 on any of your Knowledge checks, even if your&rsquo;e in immediate danger or distracted. You may expend one use of inspiration to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check even if you&rsquo;re in immediate danger or distracted.

	<dt id=ElvenImmunities>		Elven Immunities
	<dd>				You are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.

	<dt id=ElvenMagic>		Elven Magic
	<dd>				You receive a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance and a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties of magic items.

	<dt id=FencingGrace>		Fencing Grace
	<dd>				When wielding a rapier one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon&rsquo;s damage. The rapier must be one appropriate for your size. You do not gain this benefit while fighting with two weapons or using flurry of blows, or anytime another hand is otherwise occupied.  In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against attempts to disarm you of your rapier while you have at least 1 panache point.

	<dt id=Inspiration>		Inspiration (Ex)
	<dd>				You have an inspiration pool equal to &frac12; you investigator level + your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) which refreshes each day, typically after you get a restful night&rsquo;s sleep.  As a free action, you can expend one use of inspiration from your pool to add 1d6 to the result of an ability check or skill check, including any on which you take 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. You can only use inspiration once per check or roll. You can use inspiration on any Bluff, Diplomacy, Disable Device, Disguise, Heal, Intimidate, Knowledge, Linguistics, Perception, Profession, Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth skill checks without expending a use of inspiration.  Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.

	<dt id=InspiredFinesse>		Inspired Finesse (Ex)
	<dd>				You gain the benefits of Weapon Finesse with the rapier (this ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisits) and gain Weapon Focus (rapier) as a bonus feat.

	<dt id=InspiredPanache>		Inspired Panache (Ex)
	<dd>				At the start of each day, you gain a number of panache points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) which you can spend to accomplish <a href=#Deeds>deeds</a>.  You regain panache whenever you score a critical hit with a rapier, although your panache cannot go higher than its starting value.

	<dt id=KeenRecollection>	Keen Recollection
	<dd>				You can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.

	<dt id=KnowItAll>		Know-It-All (Ex)
	<dd>				You receive a +1 bonus on skill checks for all Knowledge skills in which you are trained. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.

	<dt id=StudiedStrike>		Studied Strike (Ex)
	<dd>				You can make a studied strike against the target of your <a href=#StudiedCombat>studied combat</a> as a free action, upon successfully hitting your studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.  If your attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), you may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If you chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &minus;44 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.  You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.

	<dt id=Trapfinding>		Trapfinding (Ex)
	<dd>				Add &frac12; your investigator level (round down) to Perception checks to locate traps and to Disable Device skill checks. You can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The bonus to Disable Device is already included above.

	<dt id=TrapSense>		Trap Sense (Ex)
	<dd>				You gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.  These bonuses increase by 1 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).
</dl>





<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>
	<dt id="AdaptiveBow">		<i>Adaptive +2 Composite Longbow</i>
	<dd>				This bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder&rsquo;s Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired.

	<dt id=Antitoxin>		Antitoxin
	<dd>				If you drink a vial of antitoxin, you gain a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.

	<dt id=BagOfHolding>		<i>Bag of Holding (Type I)</i>
	<dd>				This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The <i>bag of holding</i> opens into a nondimensional space which can contain 30 cubic feet.  Regardless of what is put into the bag, up to a maximum weight of 250 pounds, the bag weighs 15 pounds.
	
<p>
If a <i>bag of holding</i> is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a <i>bag of holding</i> is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a <i>bag of holding</i> is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold,in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.

<p>
Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
If a <i>bag of holding</i> is placed within a <i>portable hole</i>, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a <i>portable hole</i> is placed within a <i>bag of holding</i>, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the <i>portable hole</i> and <i>bag of holding</i> in the process.

	<dt id=CelestialLamp>		<i>Celestial Lamp</i>
	<dd>				This polished lantern contains a <a href="Spellbook.htm#Continual Flame" target=_blank><i>continual flame</i></a> and sheds light as a common lamp. If its font of consecrated crystal and metalwork is filled with holy water, the lamp&rsquo;s light is sanctified for 24 hours, adding a +1 bonus to the save DC of channeled positive energy or energy channeled to harm evil outsiders within a 30-foot radius.
	
	<dt id=CircletOfPersuasion>	<i>Circlet of Persuasion</i>
	<dd>				This delicately engraved silver headband grants its wearer a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks.

	<dt id=Headband>		<i>Headband of Vast Intelligence +2</i>
	<dd>				This intricate gold headband is decorated with several small blue and deep purple gemstones. The headband grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and grants a number of skill ranks in Use Magic Device equal to the wearer&rsquo;s total Hit Dice. These ranks do not stack with the ranks a creature already possesses.

	<dt id=RagnarsCloak>		<i>Ragnar&rsquo;s Cloak</i>
	<dd>				This cloak combines the effects of a <i>cloak of resistance +3</i> and <i>muleback cords</i>.  As such, it provides a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws, makes the wearer&rsquo;s muscles appear larger, and let the wearer treat his Strength score as 8 higher than normal when determining his carrying capacity.

	<dt id=RagnarsRing>		<i>Ragnar&rsquo;s Ring</i>
	<dd>				This ring combines the effects of a <i>ring of feather falling</i> and a <i>ring of spell knowledge (type 1)</i>.  If the wearer falls more than 5 feet, it activates immediately and acts exactly like a <a href="Spellbook.htm#Feather Fall" target=_blank><i>feather fall</i></a> effect.  Additionally, a spontaneous arcane spellcaster gains the knowledge of a single 1st- or 2nd-level spell.  The wearer must still encounter a written, active, or cast version of the spell and succeed at a DC 20 Spellcraft check to teach the spell to the ring. Thereafter, the wearer may cast the spell as though he knew the spell and it appeared on his class spell list.  Arcane spells that do not appear on the wearer&rsquo;s class list are treated as one level higher for all purposes (storage and casting).  Currently, the ring stores <i>magic missile.</i>

	<dt id=SpellstoringRapier>	Spell Storing Rapier
	<dd>				This weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it.  A <i>spell storing</i> weapon emits a strong aura of the evocation school, plus the aura of the spell currently stored.

	<dt id=SpellguardBracers>	Spellguard Bracers
	<dd>				These bracers grant the wearer a +2 bonus on concentration checks made to cast defensively. Three times per day, the wearer can choose to roll a concentration check to cast defensively twice and take the better result. 

	<dt id=WingedBoots>		<i>Winged Boots</i>
	<dd>				These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. On command, they sprout wings at the heel and let the wearer fly, without having to maintain concentration, as if affected by a <a href="Spellbook.htm#Fly" target=_blank><i>fly</i></a> spell (including a +4 bonus on Fly skill checks). The wearer can fly three times per day for up to 5 minutes per flight.
