<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class=big>
<h2 class=top>Swift Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=ArcaneStrike>		Arcane Strike
	<dd>				For 1 round, your weapons deal +1 damage and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This bonus increases by +1 for every five caster levels you possess, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.  While you are bloodraging, you don&rsquo;t need to spend a swift action to use your Arcane Strike &ndash; it is always in effect. When you use this ability with Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike, the bonus on damage rolls for Arcane Strike is multiplied by the number of times (two, three, or four) you roll damage dice for one of those feats.
</dl>


<h2>Standard Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=BreathWeapon>		Breath Weapon (Su)
	<dd>				You gain a breath weapon which deals 1d6 points of acid damage per bloodrager level in a 60&rsquo; line.  Those caught in the area of the breath receive a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier.  You can use your breath weapon twice per day.  At 16th level, you can use this ability three times per day. At 20th level, you can use this ability four times per day.
</dl>


<h2>Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=PowerAttack>	Power Attack
	<dd>			You can take a &minus;3 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +6 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased to +9 if you are attacking with a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon using two hands, and is halved to +3 if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon.  You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.
</dl>


<h2>Free Action Abilities</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=Bloodrage>	Bloodrage (Su)
	<dd>			You can enter a bloodrage for a number of round per day equal to 10 + your Constitution modifer.  At each level after 1st, you can bloodrage for an additional 2 rounds/day.  Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like <i>bear&rsquo;s endurance</i>) don&rsquo;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.

<p>
While in a bloodrage, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, you take a &minus;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

<p>
You can end your bloodrage as a free action.  When the bloodrage ends, you are fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage.  You cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your bloodrage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death.

<p>
Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&rsquo;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.

<p>
While in a bloodrage, you take on a physical transformation influenced by your bloodline and powered by the magic that roils within you.  Once the bloodrage ends, any physical changes you underwent revert, restoring you to normal.  Your current change are:
	<dl class=Options>
		<dt id=Claws>			Claws (Su)
		<dd>				You grow claws.  These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack, using your full base attack bonus. These attacks deal 1d6 points of damage each plus your Strength modifier.  At 4th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  At 8th level, the damage increases to 1d8 points. At 12th level, these claws deal an additional 1d6 points of acid damage on a hit.

		<dt id=DraconicResistance>	Draconic Resistance (Ex)
		<dd>				At 4th level, you gain resistance 5 against your energy type and a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. At 8th level, your energy resistance increases to 10 and your natural armor bonus increases to +2. At 16th level, your natural armor bonus increases to +4.
	</dl>
</dl>


<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id=BestialAspect>		Bestial Aspect (Su)
	<dd>				Whenever you gain a natural attack through the use of a polymorph spell, you can increase the damage done by that attack by one die. If the spell grants multiple natural attacks, you must choose one kind of natural attack for the ability to enhance. At 9th level, if your altered form grants you a new mode of movement, that movement&rsquo;s base speed increases by 10 feet. This is an enhancement bonus. If your bloodrage powers already grant natural attacks or alternate modes of movement, then the bonuses granted by bestial aspect also apply to these bloodrage powers.
	
	<dt id=Blindsense>			Blindsense (Ex)
	<dd>				You notices things you cannot see.  You usually do not need to make Perception checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within range of your blindsense ability, provided that you have line of effect to that creature. Any opponent you cannot see still has total concealment against you, and you still have the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects your movement.  You are still denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures you cannot see.

	<dt id=BloodCasting>		Blood Casting (Su)
	<dd>				You gain the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. You can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, you can cast and concentrate on only your bloodrager spells; spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.

	<dt id=BloodOfDragons>		Blood of Dragons
	<dd>				You add your dragon disciple levels to your bloodrager levels when determining the powers gained from your bloodline. This ability does not grant bonus spells to unless you possess spell slots of an appropriate level. Such bonus spells are automatically granted if you gains spell slots of the spell&rsquo;s level. 

	<dt id=DragonBite>		Dragon Bite (Ex)
	<dd>				Whenever you use bloodline to grow claws, you also gains a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the dragon disciple is Small), plus 1 &frac12; times your Strength modifier.  Upon reaching 6th level dragon disciple, this bite also deals 1d6 points of acid damage.

	<dt id=EldritchClaws>		Eldritch Claws
	<dd>				Your natural weapons are considered both magic and silver for purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

	<dt id=EschewMaterials>		Eschew Materials
	<dd>				You can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal.

	<dt id=FastMovement>		Fast Movement (Ex)
	<dd>				Your land speed is faster than is normal for your race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when you are wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load.  This bonus applies before your speed is modified due to any armor worn or load carried, and stacks with any other bonuses to your land speed.

	<dt id=FuriousTransformation>	Furious Transformation (Su)
	<dd>				You can attempt to bolster any transmutation spell from the bloodrager spell list with the polymorph subschool while bloodraging. You must succeed at a concentration check as if casting defensively to modify the spell; otherwise, the spell is wasted. If you succeed, the spell is treated as if you had the Extend Spell metamagic feat. You must be the spell&rsquo;s intended target or cast a spell with a range of personal to gain this effect. If you cast a spell that is linked to your own bloodline, such as a rageshaper with the elemental bloodline who casts <i>elemental body I</i>, the spell is automatically extended without forcing the concentration check, so long as you cast it while in a bloodrage.

	<dt id=NaturalArmor>		Natural Armor (Ex)
	<dd>				As your skin thickens, you take on more and more of your progenitor&rsquo;s physical aspect. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level dragon disciple, you gain a +1 increase to your existing natural armor (if any).  These bonuses stack with one another. 

	<dt id=UncannyDodge>		Uncanny Dodge (Ex)
	<dd>				You cannot be caught flat-footed, nor do you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible.  You still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized, and you can still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against you.
</dl>



<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>
	<dt id="AdaptiveBow">		<i>Adaptive +1 Composite Longbow</i>
	<dd>				This bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder&rsquo;s Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired.

	<dt id="CaivreAmulet">		<i>Caivre&rsquo;s Amulet</i>
	<dd>				This special amulet combines the effects of an <i>amulet of mighty fists +2</i> and an <i>amulet of natural armor +1</i>.  It grants a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls with unarmed attacks and natural weapons and a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor.

	<dt id="CaivreRing">		<i>Caivre&rsquo;s Ring</i>
	<dd>				This special ring combines the effects of a <i>ring of sustenance</i> and a <i>ring of ancestral blood magic</i>.

<p>
In its first function, the ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind; its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but this does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
In its second function, while the wearer is bloodraging, he can cast a bonus spell gained from his bloodrager bloodline without expending a spell slot. He can do this three times per day, and must expend a number of rounds of bloodrage equal to the level of the spell to be cast. The wearer must meet all the other requirements for spellcasting.

	<dt id="IounTorch">		<i>Ioun Torch</i>
	<dd>				This item is merely a burned out, dull gray sphere <i>ioun stone</i> with a <i>continual flame</i> spell cast upon it. It retains the ability to float and orbit, and allows Caivre to carry light and still have his hands free.
</dl>
