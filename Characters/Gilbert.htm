<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class=big>
<h2 class=top>Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=PowerAttack>	Power Attack
	<dd>			You can take a &minus;3 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +6 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased to +9 if you are attacking with a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon using two hands, and is halved to +3 if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon.  You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.
</dl>


<h2>Passive Abilities</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=Hatred>		Hatred
	<dd>			You gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the orc and goblinoid subtypes.
</dl>


<h2>Standard Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=AuraOfProt>	Aura of Protection (Su)
	<dd>			You can emit a 30-foot aura of protection for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. You and your allies within this aura gain a +1 deflection bonus to AC and resistance 5 against all elements (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic). The deflection bonus increases by +1 for every four cleric levels you possess beyond 8th. At 14th level, the resistance against all elements increases to 10. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

	<dt id=ChannelEnergy>	Channel Energy (Su)
   	<dd>			You can cause a burst of positive energy that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30&rsquo; radius centered on yourself, though you can choose to exclude yourself from the effect. Living creatures are healed of 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st; undead instead take the same amount of damage, though they receive a Will save for &frac12; damage (DC = 10 + &frac12; cleric level + Cha modifier). Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total. This ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity and you must be able to present your holy symbol. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to five plus your Charisma modifier.

	<dt id=DeflectAura>	Deflection Aura (Su)
	<dd>			Once each day, you can emit a 20-foot aura for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. Allies within the aura gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC and combat maneuver defense.

	<dt id=HolyLance>	Holy Lance (Su)
	<dd>			You can give a weapon you touch the <i>holy</i> special weapon quality for a number of rounds equal to &frac12; your cleric level. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th.

	<dt id=TouchOfGood>	Touch of Good (Su)
	<dd>			You can touch a creature as a standard action, granting a sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws equal to half your cleric level (minimum 1) for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
</dl>


<h2>Full-Round Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=LegionBlessing>	Legion&rsquo;s Blessing (Su)
	<dd>			You may confer the effects of a single harmless spell with a range of touch to a number of creatures equal to half your cleric level. The spell&rsquo;s range remains touch, so all intended recipients must be within your reach when the spell is cast. Using the legion&rsquo;s blessing expends the prepared spell, but it also requires you to sacrifice another prepared spell three levels higher, as when spontaneously using a cure or inflict spell. The higher-level spell is not cast but is simply lost, its magical energy used to power the legion&rsquo;s blessing.
</dl>
