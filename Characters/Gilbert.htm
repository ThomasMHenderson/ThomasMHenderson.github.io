<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<h2 class="top">Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="PowerAttack">	Power Attack</dt>
	<dd>			You can take a &minus;4 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +8 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased to +12 if you are attacking with a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon using two hands, and is halved to +3 if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon.  You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.  When you are wielding a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon with two hands, you do not suffer Power Attack&rsquo;s penalty on melee attack rolls on the first attack you make each turn. You still suffer the penalty on any additional attacks, including attacks of opportunity.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Move Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="QuickChannel">	Quick Channel (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			You may <a href="#ChannelEnergy">channel energy</a> as a move action by spending 2 daily uses of that ability.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Standard Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="ChannelEnergy">	Channel Energy (Su)</dt>
   	<dd>			You can cause a burst of positive energy that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30&rsquo; radius centered on yourself, though you can choose to exclude yourself from the effect. Living creatures are healed of 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st; undead instead take the same amount of damage, though they receive a Will save for &frac12; damage (DC = 10 + &frac12; cleric level + Cha modifier). Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total. This ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity and you must be able to present your holy symbol. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to five plus your Charisma modifier.</dd>

	<dt id="FlightMastery">	Flight Mastery</dt>
	<dd>			You can cause an item that has a transmutation spell of 2nd level or higher listed in its construction requirements to cast <a href="Spellbook.htm#fly" target="_blank"><i>fly</i></a> at a caster level equal to your BAB.  You can use this feat once per day, plus an additional time per day at base Fortitude save bonus +9 and +12.</dd>

	<dt id="HolyLance">	Holy Lance (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			You can give a weapon you touch the <i>holy</i> special weapon quality for a number of rounds equal to &frac12; your cleric level. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th.</dd>
</dt>
	<dt id="TouchOfGood">	Touch of Good (Su)
	<dd>			You can touch a creature as a standard action, granting a sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws equal to half your cleric level (minimum 1) for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Full-Round Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="LegionBlessing">	Legion&rsquo;s Blessing (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You may confer the effects of a single harmless spell with a range of touch to a number of creatures equal to half your cleric level. The spell&rsquo;s range remains touch, so all intended recipients must be within your reach when the spell is cast. Using the legion&rsquo;s blessing expends the prepared spell, but it also requires you to sacrifice another prepared spell three levels higher, as when spontaneously using a cure or inflict spell. The higher-level spell is not cast but is simply lost, its magical energy used to power the legion&rsquo;s blessing.</dd>

<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id="Armor">				<i>Adamantine Full Plate +5</i></dt>
	<dd>					This set of <i>+5 full plate</i> grants its wearer DR 3/&mdash;.</dd>

	<dt id="BootsStridingSpringing">	<i>Boots of Striding and Springing</i></dt>
	<dd>					These boots increase the wearer&rsquo;s base land speed by 10 feet. In addition to this striding ability (considered an enhancement bonus), these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. He can jump with a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks.</dd>

	<dt id="GilbertsHeadband">		<i>Gilbert&rsquo;s Headband</i></dt>
	<dd>					This headband combines the effects of a <i>headband of mental prowess (Wis, Cha) +6</i> and a <i>phylactery of positive channeling.</i>  In its latter function, it allows channelers of positive energy to increase the amount of damage dealt to undead creatures by +2d6. This also increases the amount of damage healed by living creatures.</dd>
	
	<dt id="Warhammer">			<i>Holy Warhammer +5</i></dt>
	<dd>					This warhammer is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.</dd>
