<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<h2 class="top">Free Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="PotentMagic">		Potent Magic (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				Whenever you cast a wizard spell, you can expent 1 point from your arcane reservoir as a free action to increase the caster level by 2 or increase the spell&rsquo;s DC by 2.  You can expend no more than 1 point from your reservoir on a given spell in this way.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Immediate Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="Counterspell">		Counterspell (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				By expending 1 point from your arcane reservoir, you can attempt to counter a spell as it is being cast. You must identify the spell being cast as normal. If you successfully do so, you can attempt to counter the spell as an immediate action and by expending an available spell of a level at least one higher than the level of the spell being cast. To counterspell, you must attempt a dispel check as if using <a href="Spellbook.htm#Dispel Magic" target="_blank"><i>dispel magic</i></a>. If the spell being countered is one that you have prepared, you can instead expend that spell, and you receive a +5 bonus on the dispel check. Counterspelling in this way does not trigger any feats or other abilities that normally occur when a spellcaster successfully counters a spell.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Move Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="DimensionalSlide">	Dimensional Slide (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can expend 1 point from your <a href="#ArcaneReservoir">arcane reservoir</a> to create a dimensional crack that you can step through to reach another location. This ability is used as part of a move action or withdraw action, allowing you to move up to 10 feet per wizard level to any location you can see. This counts as 5 feet of movement. You can only use this ability once per round. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way, but any other movement you attempt as part of your move action provokes as normal.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Full-Round Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="QuickStudy">		Quick Study (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You can prepare a spell in place of an existing spell by expending 1 point from your <a href="#ArcaneReservoir">arcane reservoir</a>.  You must be able to reference your spellbook when using this ability.  The spell prepared must be of the same level as the spell being replaced.  Using this ability provokes an attack of opportunity.</dd>
</dl>



<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="ArcaneReservoir">	Arcane Reservoir (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You have an innate pool of magical energy that you can draw upon to fuel your arcanist exploits and enhance your spells. The arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + your wizard level. Each day, when preparing spells, your arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + &frac12; your arcanist level. Any points you had from the previous day are lost. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</dd>

	<dt id="ElementalSpell">	Elemental Spell</dt>
	<dd>				You may replace a spell&rsquo;s normal damage with acid damage or split the spell&rsquo;s damage, so that half is of that energy type and half is of its normal type. An elemental spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.</dd>

	<dt id="ExtendSpell">		Extend Spell</dt>
	<dd>				An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent is not affected by this feat. An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.</dd>

	<dt id="HeightenSpell">		Heighten Spell</dt>
	<dd>				A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.</dd>

	<dt id="IntensifiedSpell">	Intensified Spell</dt>
	<dd>				An intensified spell increases the maximum number of damage dice by 5 levels. You must actually have sufficient caster levels to surpass the maximum in order to benefit from this feat. No other variables of the spell are affected, and spells that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not affected by this feat. An intensified spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.</dd>

	<dt id="MaximizeSpell">		Maximize Spell</dt>
	<dd>				All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.</dd>

	<dt id="QuickenSpell">		Quicken Spell</dt>
	<dd>				Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened.  A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity.</dd>

	<dt id="PreferredSpell">	Preferred Spell</dt>
	<dd>				You can spontaneously cast a preferred spell by sacrificing a prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level. You can apply any metamagic feats you possess to this spell when you cast it. This increases the minimum level of the prepared spell or spell slot you must sacrifice in order to cast it but does not affect the casting time.</dd>

	<dt id="SpellPerfection">	Spell Perfection</dt>
	<dd>				Whenever you cast your perfected spell, you may apply any one metamagic feat you have to that spell without affecting its level or casting time, as long as the total modified level of the spell does not use a spell slot above 9th level. In addition, if you have other feats which allow you to apply a set numerical bonus to any aspect of this spell (such as Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, Weapon Focus [ray], and so on), double the bonus granted by that feat when applied to this spell.</dd>
</dl>




<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>
	<dt id="BlessedBook">		<i>Blessed Book</i></dt>
	<dd>				You can fill the 1,000 pages of this book with spells without paying the material cost.</dd>

	<dt id="Bracelets">		<i>Bracelets of Defiant Wind</i></dt>
	<dd>				These bracelets activate once per day as an immediate action to safeguard against sudden airborne attacks and effects by automatically surrounding their wearer in a cylinder of pure wind and elemental air. This effect functions simultaneously as both <a href="Spellbook.htm#Air Bubble" target="_blank"><i>air bubble</i></a> and <a href="Spellbook.htm#Wind Wall" target="_blank"><i>wind wall</i></a>, protecting against missile weapons, gases, and most gaseous breath weapons. It also activates underwater if the wearer begins to drown. Once activated, the effect lasts for 10 rounds.</dd>

	<dt id="DuncansShirt">		<i>Duncan&rsquo;s Shirt</i></dt>
	<dd>				This shirt combines the benefits of a <i>shirt of spite</i> and an <i>unfettered shirt</i>.  Once per day, the wearer can cast <a href="Spellbook.htm#Spite" target="_blank"><i>spite</i></a>.  Once per day on command as a standard action, the wearer gains the benefits of <a href="Spellbook.htm#Freedom of Movement" target="_blank"><i>freedom of movement</i></a> for 10 minutes.  Both function at CL 7.</dd>

	<dt id="HandyHaversack">	<i>Handy Haversack</i></dt>
	<dd>				A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.</dd>

	<dt id="Headband">		<i>Headband of Vast Intelligence +6</i></dt>
	<dd>				This headband grants the wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.  If also grants a number of skill ranks in three skills (Knowledge [history, planes, religion]) equal to the wearer&rsquo;s total Hit Dice and permits the wearer to speak Dwarven, Elven, and Goblin.</dd>

	<dt id="MetamagicRodQuicken">	<i>Lesser Metamagic Rod of Quicken Spell</i></dt>
	<dd>				Three times per day, this rod allows you to affect a spell of up to third level with the Quicken Spell metamagic feat without changing the spell slot of the alterered spell.  You must be holding the rod to use it, and you may only use one metamagic rod on any given spell, but you may combine a rod with metamagic feats you possess.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
A quickened spell is cast as a swift action which does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened.</p></dd>

	<dt id="MetamagicRodPersist">	<i>Metamagic Rod of Persistent Spell</i></dt>
	<dd>				Three times per day, this rod allows you to affect a spell of up to sixth level with the Persistent Spell metamagic feat without changing the spell slot of the alterered spell.  You must be holding the rod to use it, and you may only use one metamagic rod on any given spell, but you may combine a rod with metamagic feats you possess.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
 Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell&rsquo;s effect do not benefit from this feat.</p></dd>

	<dt id="Necklace">		<i>Necklace of Netted Stars</i></dt>
	<dd>				While wearing a <i>necklace of netted stars</i>, the wearer can create <a href="Spellbook.htm#Dancing Lights" target="_blank"><i>dancing lights</i></a> at will and <a href="Spellbook.htm#Wandering Star Motes" target="_blank"><i>wandering star motes</i></a> once per day, at CL 12. In addition, each of the seven jewels of the necklace can recall a previously cast 1st-level or 0-level spell, as a pearl of power.  Once per day, the wearer may use the necklace to catch a spell targeted at him, as if readying an action to counterspell using <i>dispel magic</i>, with a bonus on the check equal to 12 + the number of jewels not yet used to recall spells that day. If all jewels have been used, this ability cannot be used that day. The level of the spell to be countered must be less than or equal to the number of unused jewels. If the counterspell succeeds, the spell is negated and the wearer can use its magical energy to recall a previously cast spell of the same level or lower as an immediate action. Whether or not the attempt succeeds, this action exhausts the power of all of the necklace&rsquo;s jewels for that day.</dd>

	<dt id="PermanentSpells">	Permanent Spells</dt>
	<dd>				Duncan has used <a href="Spellbook.htm#Permanency" target="_blank"><i>permanency</i></a> to make three spells permanent on himself, at CL 15: <a href="Spellbook.htm#Arcane Sight" target="_blank"><i>arcane sight</i></a>, <a href="Spellbook.htm#Darkvision" target="_blank"><i>darkvision</i></a>, and <a href="Spellbook.htm#See Invisibility" target="_blank"><i>see invisibility</i></a>.</dd>

	<dt id="RingOfFreedom">		<i>Ring of Freedom of Movement</i></dt>
	<dd>				This gold ring allows the wearer to act as if continually under the effect of a <a href="Spellbook.htm#Freedom of Movement" target="_blank"><i>freedom of movement</i></a> spell.</dd>

	<dt id="RingOfSustenance">	<i>Ring of Sustenance</i></dt>
	<dd>				This ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind; its wearer only needs to sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.</dd>

	<dt id="Scabbard">		<i>Scabbard of Many Blades</i></dt>
	<dd>				This scabbard can hold multiple melee weapons in an extradimensional space, including weapons that would not normally fit in any kind of scabbard or sheath. It can hold up to four two-handed weapons. Two one-handed or light melee weapons can fit in each two-handed weapon slot, for a maximum capacity of eight one-handed or light melee weapons. Only weapons designed to be used by creatures the same size as the wearer or smaller can be kept in a <i>scabbard of many blades</i>. The scabbard can&rsquo;t be used to store shields (even if they can be used to make melee attacks), gauntlets, improvised weapons, or wands, but can store rods (which are treated as one-handed weapons) and magic staves (which are treated as two-handed weapons).  When the wearer draws a weapon from the scabbard, if he does not lose his grip on it (keeping it in his hands at all times), as a move action he can have it switch places with another weapon in the scabbard. If the wearer has the Quick Draw feat, he can do this as a swift action. If the wearer loses his grip on a weapon drawn from the scabbard, that weapon can&rsquo;t switch places with another weapon until it has been, sheathed in the <i>scabbard of many blades</i> and drawn again.</dd>
