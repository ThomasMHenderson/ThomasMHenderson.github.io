<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<h2 class="top">Free Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="PotentMagic">		Potent Magic (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				Whenever you cast a wizard spell, you can expent 1 point from your arcane reservoir as a free action to increase the caster level by 2 or increase the spell&rsquo;s DC by 2.  You can expend no more than 1 point from your reservoir on a given spell in this way.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Move Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="DimensionalSlide">	Dimensional Slide (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can expend 1 point from your <a href="#ArcaneReservoir">arcane reservoir</a> to create a dimensional crack that you can step through to reach another location. This ability is used as part of a move action or withdraw action, allowing you to move up to 10 feet per wizard level to any location you can see. This counts as 5 feet of movement. You can only use this ability once per round. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way, but any other movement you attempt as part of your move action provokes as normal.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Full-Round Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="QuickStudy">		Quick Study (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You can prepare a spell in place of an existing spell by expending 1 point from your <a href="#ArcaneReservoir">arcane reservoir</a>.  You must be able to reference your spellbook when using this ability.  The spell prepared must be of the same level as the spell being replaced.  Using this ability provokes an attack of opportunity.</dd>
</dl>



<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="ArcaneReservoir">	Arcane Reservoir (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You have an innate pool of magical energy that you can draw upon to fuel your arcanist exploits and enhance your spells. The arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + your wizard level. Each day, when preparing spells, your arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + &frac12; your arcanist level. Any points you had from the previous day are lost. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</dd>

	<dt id="ExtendSpell">		Extend Spell</dt>
	<dd>				An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent is not affected by this feat. An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.</dd>

	<dt id="IntensifiedSpell">	Intensified Spell</dt>
	<dd>				An intensified spell increases the maximum number of damage dice by 5 levels. You must actually have sufficient caster levels to surpass the maximum in order to benefit from this feat. No other variables of the spell are affected, and spells that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not affected by this feat. An intensified spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.</dd>

	<dt id="QuickenSpell">		Quicken Spell</dt>
	<dd>				Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened.  A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity.</dd>

	<dt id="ReachSpell">		Reach Spell</dt>
	<dd>				You can alter a spell with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. A reach spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a spell slot three levels higher. Spells modified by this feat that require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks.  Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.</dd>
</dl>




<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>
	<dt id="BlessedBook">		<i>Blessed Book</i></dt>
	<dd>				You can fill the 1,000 pages of this book with spells without paying the material cost.</dd>

	<dt id="HandyHaversack">	<i>Handy Haversack</i></dt>
	<dd>				A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.</dd>

	<dt id="Headband">		<i>Headband of Vast Intelligence +6</i></dt>
	<dd>				This headband grants the wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.  If also grants a number of skill ranks in three skills (Knowledge [history, planes, religion]) equal to the wearer&rsquo;s total Hit Dice and permits the wearer to speak <span class="note">3 languages</span>.</dd>

	<dt id="MetamagicRodQuicken">	<i>Lesser Metamagic Rod of Quicken Spell</i></dt>
	<dd>				Three times per day, this rod allows you to affect a spell of up to third level with the Quicken Spell metamagic feat without changing the spell slot of the alterered spell.  You must be holding the rod to use it, and you may only use one metamagic rod on any given spell, but you may combine a rod with metamagic feats you possess.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
A quickened spell is cast as a swift action which does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened.</p></dd>

	<dt id="MetamagicRodPersist">	<i>Metamagic Rod of Persistent Spell</i></dt>
	<dd>				Three times per day, this rod allows you to affect a spell of up to sixth level with the Persistent Spell metamagic feat without changing the spell slot of the alterered spell.  You must be holding the rod to use it, and you may only use one metamagic rod on any given spell, but you may combine a rod with metamagic feats you possess.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
 Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell&rsquo;s effect do not benefit from this feat.</p></dd>

	<dt id="RingOfSustenance">	<i>Ring of Sustenance</i></dt>
	<dd>				This ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind; its wearer only needs to sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.</dd>
</dl>


<h1>Notes</h1>
<hr class="big">
<ul class="note">
	<li>	We need to pick some languages.</li>
	<li>	You should choose 3 of the skills we maxed out to come from the headband.  I think those were going to be knowledge (history/planes/religion), but I don&rsquo;t recall for sure.</li>
	<li>	And we need an alignment.</li>
</ul>
