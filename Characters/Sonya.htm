<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class=big>
<h2 class=top>Passive Abilities</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=ImprovedPreciseShot>	Improved Precise Shot
	<dd>				Your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.

	<dt id=PreciseShot>		Precise Shot
	<dd>				You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard &minus;4 penalty on your attack roll.

</dl>


<h2>Move Action Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=StudiedTarget>		Studied Target (Ex)
	<dd>				You can study an opponent you can see as a move action.  This gives you a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1.  The bonuses remain in effect until the opponent is dead or you study a new target.  When you deal sneak attack damage, you can study the target of your sneak attack as an immediate action, allowing you to apply your studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses granted by studied target increase by 1 and you are able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time.  At 7th level, you can study an opponent as a move or swift action.
</dl>


<h2>Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=DeadlyAim>	Deadly Aim
	<dd>			You can choose to take a &minus;1 penalty on all ranged attack rolls to gain a +2 bonus on all ranged damage rolls. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every +4 thereafter, the penalty increases by &minus;1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.

	<dt id=ManyShot>	Many Shot
	<dd>			When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires two arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as your favored enemy bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each arrow.

	<dt id=PointBlankShot>	Point-Blank Shot
	<dd>			You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.

	<dt id=RapidShot>	Rapid Shot
	<dd>			You can make one extra attack per round with a missile weapon at your highest attack bonus, but all attacks made in this round suffer a &minus;2 penalty.  You must use a full attack to use this option.
</dl>



<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id=PointBlankMaster>	Point-Blank Master
	<dd>				You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when firing a longbow while threatened.

	<dt id=SlayerTalent>		Slayer Talents
	<dd>				Your slayer talents are Trapfinding, Weapon Training, Ranger Combat Style (three times), and Trap Spotter.

	<dt id=SnapShot>		Snap Shot
	<dd>				While wielding a ranged weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you threaten squares within 5 feet of you. You can make attacks of opportunity with that ranged weapon. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when making a ranged attack as an attack of opportunity.

	<dt id=SneakAttack>		Sneak Attack
	<dd>				Whenever you flank your target or it would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC, you do extra damage.  If you score a critical hit with a sneak attack, the extra damage is not multiplied.  Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.  You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage; you cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack.

	<dt id=Stalker>			Stalker (Ex)
	<dd>				You gain your studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against your studied opponent.

	<dt id=Track>			Track (Ex)
	<dd>				Add &frac12; your slayer level (round down) to Survival checks for following tracks.

	<dt id=Trapfinding>		Trapfinding (Ex)
	<dd>				Add &frac12; your slayer level (round down) to Perception checks to locate traps and to Disable Device skill checks. You can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The bonus to Disable Device is already included above. 

	<dt id=TrapSpotter>		Trap Spotter (Ex):
	<dd>				Whenever you come within 10 feet of a trap, you receive an immediate Perception skill check to notice the trap. This check should be made in secret by the GM.
</dl>



<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>

	<dt id="SonyasBow">		<i>Adaptive Corrosive Composite Longbow +2</i>
	<dd>				Upon command, this bow becomes slick with acid and deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit.  The acid does not harm the wielder, and remains until another command is given.  Additionally, the bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder&rsquo;s Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired.

	<dt id=CovenantRing>		Covenant Ring
	<dd>				When Sabrae and Sonya each wear one of these silver rings, each gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear effects.  This bonus ends if their emotional bond is severed, or if one of them is not wearing the ring.

	<dt id=HandyHaversack>		<i>Handy Haversack</i>
	<dd>				A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does. 

	<dt id=Bracers>			<i>Lesser Bracers of Archery</i>
	<dd>				These bracers look like normal protective wear. They empower the wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if she were proficient in its use. If she already has proficiency with any type of bow, she gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls whenever using that type of bow. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. 

	<dt id="IounTorch">		<i>Ioun Torch</i>
	<dd>				This item is merely a burned out, dull gray sphere <i>ioun stone</i> with a <i>continual flame</i> spell cast upon it. It retains the ability to float and orbit, and allows Sonya to carry light and still have her hands free.

	<dt id=SilverRaven>		<i>Silver Raven Figurine of Wondrous Power</i>
	<dd>				This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an <a href="Spellbook.htm#Animal Messenger"><i>animal messenger</i></a> spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities.  It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.
