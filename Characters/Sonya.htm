<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class=big>
<h2 class=top>Passive Abilities</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=ImprovedPreciseShot>	Improved Precise Shot
	<dd>				Your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.

	<dt id=PreciseShot>		Precise Shot
	<dd>				You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard &minus;4 penalty on your attack roll.

</dl>


<h2>Swift Action Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=StudiedTarget>		Studied Target (Ex)
	<dd>				You can study an opponent you can see as a move action.  This gives you a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1.  The bonuses remain in effect until the opponent is dead or you study a new target.  When you deal sneak attack damage, you can study the target of your sneak attack as an immediate action, allowing you to apply your studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses granted by studied target increase by 1 and you are able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time.  At 7th level, you can study an opponent as a move or swift action.
</dl>


<h2>Move Action Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=SlayersAdvance>		Slayer&rsquo;s Advance (Ex)
	<dd>				You can move up to twice your base speed once per day as a move action. You can use Stealth as part of this movement, but take a &minus;10 penalty on his check for doing so. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Standard Action Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="Quarry">		Quarry (Ex)
	<dd>				You can denote one target within your line of sight as your quarry.  When you are following the tracks of your quarty, you can take 10 on Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, you gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against your quarry, and all critical threats against your quarry are automatically confirmed. You can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. You can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If you see proof that your quarry is dead, you can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</dd>


<h2>Attack Options</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id=DeadlyAim>	Deadly Aim
	<dd>			You can choose to take a &minus;1 penalty on all ranged attack rolls to gain a +2 bonus on all ranged damage rolls. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every +4 thereafter, the penalty increases by &minus;1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.

	<dt id=ManyShot>	Many Shot
	<dd>			When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires two arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as your favored enemy bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each arrow.

	<dt id=PointBlankShot>	Point-Blank Shot
	<dd>			You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.

	<dt id=RapidShot>	Rapid Shot
	<dd>			You can make one extra attack per round with a missile weapon at your highest attack bonus, but all attacks made in this round suffer a &minus;2 penalty.  You must use a full attack to use this option.
</dl>



<h1>Other Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<dl>
	<dt id=PointBlankMaster>	Point-Blank Master
	<dd>				You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when firing a longbow while threatened.

	<dt id=SnapShot>		Snap Shot
	<dd>				While wielding a ranged weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you threaten squares within 10 feet of you. You can make attacks of opportunity with that ranged weapon. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when making a ranged attack as an attack of opportunity.

	<dt id=SneakAttack>		Sneak Attack
	<dd>				Whenever you flank your target or it would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC, you do extra damage.  If you score a critical hit with a sneak attack, the extra damage is not multiplied.  Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.  You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage; you cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack.

	<dt id=Stalker>			Stalker (Ex)
	<dd>				You gain your studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against your studied opponent.

	<dt id=SwiftTracker>		Swift Tracker (Ex)
	<dd>				You can move at your normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &minus;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice your normal speed while tracking, you take only a &minus;10 penalty instead of the normal &minus;20.

	<dt id=Track>			Track (Ex)
	<dd>				Add &frac12; your slayer level (round down) to Survival checks for following tracks.

	<dt id=Trapfinding>		Trapfinding (Ex)
	<dd>				Add &frac12; your slayer level (round down) to Perception checks to locate traps and to Disable Device skill checks. You can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The bonus to Disable Device is already included above. 

	<dt id=TrapSpotter>		Trap Spotter (Ex)
	<dd>				Whenever you come within 10 feet of a trap, you receive an immediate Perception skill check to notice the trap. This check should be made in secret by the GM.
</dl>



<h1>Equipment</h1>
<hr class=big>
<dl>
	<dt id=CelestialArmor>		<i>Celestial Armor</i>
	<dd>				This <i>+3 chainmail</i> is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of &minus;2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor and allows the wearer to use <a href="Spellbook.htm#Fly" target=_blank><i>fly</i></a> on command once per day.

	<dt id=CovenantRing>		Covenant Ring
	<dd>				When Sabrae and Sonya each wear one of these silver rings, each gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear effects.  This bonus ends if their emotional bond is severed, or if one of them is not wearing the ring.
	
	<dt id="Goggles">		<i>Goggles of Night</i>
	<dd>				These goggles have opaque dark crystal lenses.  When worn, they grant the wearer 60&rsquo; darkvision.

	<dt id=HandyHaversack>		<i>Handy Haversack</i>
	<dd>				A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does. 

	<dt id=IounTorch>		<i>Ioun Torch</i>
	<dd>				This item is merely a burned out, dull gray sphere <i>ioun stone</i> with a <i>continual flame</i> spell cast upon it. It retains the ability to float and orbit, and allows Sonya to carry light and still have her hands free.

	<dt id=Bracers>			<i>Lesser Bracers of Archery</i>
	<dd>				These bracers look like normal protective wear. They empower the wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if she were proficient in its use. If she already has proficiency with any type of bow, she gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls whenever using that type of bow. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. 

	<dt id=Luckblade>		<i>Luckblade</i>
	<dd>				This <i>+2 long sword</i> gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its possessor to reroll one roll that she just made, before the results are revealed. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it&rsquo;s worse than the original roll. 

	<dt id=SilverRaven>		<i>Silver Raven Figurine of Wondrous Power</i>
	<dd>				This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an <a href="Spellbook.htm#Animal Messenger"><i>animal messenger</i></a> spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities.  It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.

	<dt id=SonyasBow>		<i>Sonya&rsquo;s Bow</i>
	<dd>				This composite longbow has a +5 enhancement bonus.  It is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.  Additionally, the bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder&rsquo;s Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired.  Finally, three times per day the wielder of the bow can use it to cast <a href="Spellbook.htm#Gravity Bow" target="_blank"><i>gravity bow</i></a> at CL 3.
</dl>
