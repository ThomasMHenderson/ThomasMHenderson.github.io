<h1>Special Abilities</h1>
<hr class="big">
<h2 class="top">Free Actions</h2>
<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="Prescience">	Prescience (Su)</dt>
	<dd>			At the beginning of your turn, you may, as a free action, roll a single d20. At any point before your next turn, you may use the result of this roll as the result of any d20 roll you are required to make. If you do not use the d20 result before your next turn, it is lost. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>
<dl>
	<dt id="GoWithTheFlow">	Go with the Flow (Su)</dt>
   	<dd>			You can touch a creature as a standard action to suppress its strong emotions. The target is affected as the <a href="Spellbook.htm#Calm Emotions" target="_blank"><i>calm emotions</i></a> spell, except it can still take violent actions and violent actions against the target do not end the effect. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to &frac12; your druid level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</dd>
</dl>

Once per day, you can use the bonded object to cast any one spell that is in your spellbook and that you are capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared.  This spell is treated like any other spell you cast, and cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.  Your bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from your opposition school.  Your ring&rsquo;s hit points and hardness increase by +1 per wizard level you possess.</dd>

	<dt id="ArcaneSchool">		Arcane School</dt>
	<dd>				You have specialized in divination, and have selected enchantment and evocation as opposition schools.  When you prepare spells from one of your opposition schools, you must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell.  In addition, you receive a &minus;4 penalty on any skills checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of your opposition schools as a prerequisite. You arcane school gives you a number of school powers. In addition, you receive an additional spell slot of each spell level you can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, you prepare a spell from your specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in your spellbook. You can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in your school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot.</dd>

	<dt id="CombinedSpells">	Combined Spells (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can prepare and cast spells of up to 5th level from one of your spellcasting classes using the available slots from any of your other spellcasting classes.  Spells prepared or cast in this way take up a slot one level higher than they originally occupied. This ability cannot be used to cast a spell at a lower level if that spell exists on both spell lists.  The components of these spells do not change, but they otherwise follow the rules for the spellcasting class used to cast the spell.</dd>

	<dt id="ElfBlood">		Elf Blood</dt>

	<dt id="Forewarned">		Forewarned (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a Perception roll to notice a foe, but you are still considered flat-footed until you take an action. In addition, you receive a bonus on initiative checks equal to &frac12; your wizard level (minimum +1).</dd>

	<dt id="HealingTouch">		Healing Touch (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You gain a +2 bonus on Heal checks. When using Heal to provide first aid, the bonus increases to +3.</dd>

	<dt id="Mismatched">		Mismatched</dt>
	<dd>				You take a &minus;2 penalty on Reflex saves but receive a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks.</dd>

	<dt id="Multidisciplined">	Multidisciplined</dt>
	<dd>				The effects of spells you casts from all your classes are calculated as though your caster level were 1 level higher, to a maximum of your character level.</dd>

	<dt id="NaturalMedic">		Natural Medic</dt>
	<dd>				You can &ldquo;lose&rdquo; any prepared druid spell in order to cast any cure spell you can cast of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with &ldquo;cure&rdquo; in its name).</dd>

	<dt id="NatureBond">		Nature Bond (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You have access to the Water (Flowing) cleric domain.  When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, your effective cleric level is equal to your druid level. You also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. You must prepare the spell from your domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</dd>

	<dt id="SpellSynthesis">	Spell Synthesis (Su)</dt>
	<dd>				Once per day, you can cast two spells (one from each of your spellcasting classes), using one action.  Both spells must have the same casting time.  You can make any decisions concerning the spells independently. Any target affected by both spells takes a &minus;2 penalty on saves made against each spell. You receive a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance with these two spells.</dd>

	<dt id="WildEmpathy">		Wild Empathy (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your druid level and your Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.  To use wild empathy, you and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.  You can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you take a &minus;4 penalty on the check.</dd>

	<dt id="WoodlandStride">	Woodland Stride (Ex)</dt>
	<dd>				You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect you.</dd>

The seeds plant themselves in the ground and instantly grow to create any vegetation or grass that the spell requires to function inside of the spell&rsquo;s area of effect. The vegetation created by the pouch grows regardless of the terrain, and lasts the full duration of the spell, allowing the user to cast plant-altering or plant-creating spells in deserts, badlands, and other harsh terrains.</dd>
