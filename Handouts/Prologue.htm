<h1>Prologue</h1>


<p>
The land of Taldor was once a mighty empire, but has long since fallen from its former glory.  Nowadays rival nobles battle each other with bitter knights and proxy armies for personal power rathern than honor, and the uneasy peace with Qadira threatens once more to ignite into war.  But as we shall see, there is still greatness in Taldor, too&hellip;

<p>
At the height of the empire, much of Taldor was populated by small settlements interconnected by a series of roads and canals.  With Taldor&rsquo;s decline, many of these small communities have been abandoned.  Roads have been reclaimed by nature, and the canal system has fallen into disrepair.  Yet several major cities remain.  The most important is Oppara, the nation&rsquo;s capital and a teeming metropolis of over 100,000 souls, located in the delta of the River Porthmos.  The second city is Cassomir, a major trade city located at the mouth of the Sellen River and home to over 30,000 people.  In the south, the fortress city of Zimar and its 17000 citizens still defend Taldor from Qadiran invasion.

<p>
Taldor is also home to several smaller cities.  The largest of these is Maheto, a highly-defended city of about 12,000 souls located in the northern foothills of the World&rsquo;s Edge Mountains.  The city is home to a sizable dwarven population, and its craftsmen are famous throughout the region.  In the Verduran Forest to the north is the city of Wispil, the home of over 8,000 people.  Wispil has a large population of gnomes and supplies much of Taldor&rsquo;s timber and wood craft.  Yanmass and its 7,000 citizens stands on a trade route linking Taldor with Kelesh, while Ridonport and its 6000 people are built around Taldor&rsquo;s only other natural harbor.

<p>
The five of you met in Yanmass when each of you was hired by a merchant named Silas Gribb to help guard his wagon on its way to Wispil.  Caivre, a warrior, was simply looking for work, and Gribb offered a fair wage for what seemed like light duty.  The elf Sabrae was headed to the forest on some sort of pilgimage, while Sonya Valorion, an archer, was headed to Wispil for an archery competition.  Aikio, a robed tengu, is also headed to Wispil, claiming that &ldquo;grand-mere told me to go there,&rdquo; while the dwarven priest Gilbert Ironhaft felt an inner prompting which he attributed to the will of Trudd, the dwarven god of strength.

<p>
That was a little over a week ago, and you&rsquo;ve since had cause to regret your decision.  Silas seemed to be taking a rather circuitous route to get to Wispil; as expected, he followed the Verduran Fork south until its confluence with the Falling River, but then rather than turning west and taking the road to Wispil, he turned southwest and stayed on the Verduran Fork, thereby going three or four days out of his way.

<p>
At the time, his explanation &ndash; that he was seeking trade with some of the smaller towns along the Verduran Fork &ndash; seemed plausible, but earlier today (that is, Starday the 13th of Desnus), you learned otherwise.  Silas stopped in the small town of Belhaim for a late lunch, planning on following the road northwest to Wispil from there.  Unfortunately, there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest on charges of smuggling, and the town&rsquo;s rather officious sheriff duly arrested your employer.  Though Silas volubly proclaimed his innocence, a search of his wagon proved that the charges were all too true.  The five of you were nearly arrested yourselves, but were eventually able to convince Sheriff Benhovy that you knew nothing of Silas&rsquo; criminal activities.  Sheriff Benhovy and two of his deputies clapped Silas in irons, confiscated the contents of his wagon, and have already turned it around and headed west toward Cassomir, where Silas will undoubtedly stand trial and be dealt with.

<p>
This has left you in a bit of a bind.  Silas was arrested before you were even paid, and you&rsquo;re effectively stranded in this sleepy backwater.  Wispil is still 90 miles away as the crow flies (so several days&rsquo; walk), and the journey is best made in numbers because the Verduran Forest isn&rsquo;t entirely safe.  It seems prudent to wait for the next merchant wagon, but that may not be for another week!

<p>
Strangely, though, some of your number seem relatively unconcerned.  Aikio and Gilbert, who have struck up something of a friendship as mutual worshippers of the dwarven pantheon, seem quite content to wait here in Belhaim &ndash; perhaps the same inner promptings that told them to undertake the journey now tell them to linger.  Sabrae also seems untroubled by a few days&rsquo; delay, evidently preferring to take the long view.  Sonya was furious, but when she discovered that the archery tournament had been cancelled &ndash; apparently, the organizers had absconded with the prize money &ndash; she found herself at something of a loss.  Caivre would probably have preferred to continue going, for there seems to be little prospect of employment here in Belhaim, but has been forced to accede to reality.

<p>
Fortunately, many of the townsfolk seem well-disposed to you.  A rather fetching young woman named Talia Orem has taken pity on you and offered you free room and board in her inn, The Wise Piper, at least for the next few days.  With no other options, you have gratefully accepted her offer, and she has provided the five of you with a pair of rooms which, while comfortable enough, are probably not the inn&rsquo;s finest.

<p>
It&rsquo;s now dinner time, and the five of you are gathered at a long table in the inn&rsquo;s common room.  Either Talia is very popular with the locals, or her dinners are, for the common room is fairly full.  You can&rsquo;t help but think that it&rsquo;s Talia herself who is popular, since the five of you are treated to a meal of fresh bread with cheese and honey, washed down by a somewhat inferior mead.  Perhaps it would have been wiser to pay for dinner&hellip;
