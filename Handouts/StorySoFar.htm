<h1>The Story So Far</h1>

<p>
In early Desnus, 4718 AR, the party (consisting of Aikio, Cavire, Gilbert, Sabrae, and Sonya) met in Yanmass and hired on to escort the merchant Silas Gribb to Wispil.  But in the small town of Belhaim, Gribb was arrested as a smuggler, and the party stranded.  Fortunately for them, the dragon Aeteperax had designs on Belhaim, and the party was well-positioned to stop him.  His kobold minions destroyed a local landmark known as the Witchtower, killing the wizard Balthus Hunclay in the process.  The party eliminated the kobolds, cleared Hunclay Manor, rescued a shae by the name of Maffeei, and then took some time off.
</p>

<p>
In early Sarenith, they headed to Cassomir.  <i>En route</i>, their boat, the <i>Minnow</i>, was forced to put ashore on the Isle of Arenway.  While ashore, the party sans Sonya was driven into a ruined lighthouse by a horde of undead.  The party fought through the lighthouse and slew the ghostly troll Mickle, ending the curse on the lighthouse.
</p>

<p>
In Erastus, the party returned to Belhaim to attend an auction of Hunclay&rsquo;s possessions.  While there, Aeteperax sent more of his minions to attack the town, threatening to raze the town in 2 weeks unless a huge ransom was paid.  The party ultimately agreed to kill Aeteperax to save the town, which could not hope to pay the ransom.  To this end, they went to the crypt of Lady Tula Belhaim, the town&rsquo;s founder and a legendary dragon slayer, to look for gear which might help them.  The crypt was haunted, but the party was able to put an end to the undead infestation.
</p>

<p>
From there, they journeyed to the monastery of Saint Kyerixus, where the ransom was to have been paid.  They cleared the monastery of Aeteperax&rsquo;s minions and agreed to help the druid Azmur Kell rescue his pregnant wife Rima from the dragon&rsquo;s custody.  They went to Aeteperax&rsquo;s lair and after a desparate battle Sonya killed the dragon and the party freed Rima Kell.
</p>

<p>
Caivre had been slain in the fight against Aeteperax, but Belhaim&rsquo;s baroness Origena Devy promised to pay for his resurrection.  Thus the party returned to Cassomir and had Caivre brought back to life, after which they were summoned to Oppara to meet the Grand Prince.   Over the next three months, each spent a significant portion of their vast treasure. Caivre bought the Green Dragon Inn and Tavern, while Gilbert began construction of a temple to Trudd nearby. Sonya and Sabrae bough an estate on the coast a few hours outside of the city, while Aikio began construction of a tower and school of witchcraft a few days from the city.
</p>

<p>
In late Rova 4718, the party received letters from Baroness Devy, begging for their help once more.  Their numbers now bolstered by Caietano, they went to Belhaim and were sent to Bellis to attend a wedding in Baroness Devy&rsquo; name.  The wedding was attacked by evil fey under the command of the Fey Queen Rhoswen, but the party eventually infiltrated Rhoswen&rsquo;s realm, slew her, and ended the threat.
</p>

<p>
They had no time to rest on their laurels, however, for messengers immediately arrived beggging the dragon slayers of Belhaim to come to Falcon&rsquo;s Hollow and protect them from a vicious red dragon.  All was not, however, what it seemed, and the party eventually found that the dragon Pyraxus had in fact been protecting the mountain from the loggers of Falcon&rsquo;s Hollow. The party reached an agreement to try to bring peace between the two groups and returned to Falcon&rsquo;s Hollow to try to negotiate, but their attempts ended in violence and they were forced to slay Thuldren Kreed, the town&rsquo;s evil mayor. 
</p>

<p>
In Calistril 4719, Aikio sent letters to each of her colleagues asking their help to locate a scholar named Meloigne Garracy who had gone missing late in the previous year.  Aikio had been hoping to hire him for her school, but had been unable to locate him and was growing concerned.  The party agreed to investigate and found Garracy&rsquo;s last known location, a carnival near Oppara, where they found a seeress who magically transported them, against their will, to a storybook land called the Harrowed Realm.
</p>

<p>
In the Harrowed Realm, they found that the Patchwork Lord Zassrion was attempting to leave the land and invade the real world.  The party ultimately defeated several of the Harrowed Realm&rsquo;s storykin and recovered tokens which would allow them to find Zassrion&rsquo;s Striding Fortress.  Their numbers having been bolstered again, this time by Knarx, they headed for the Striding Fortress, where Gilbert was promptly slain from ambush.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the party had befriended Marzalee the Weaver, who was able to birth a storykin Gilbert for a few days, and the party went back to the Striding Fortress once more where they fought Zassrion, an immense blue dragon ultimately slain by Sabrae.  Aikio decided to stay behind to help repair the Harrowed Realm, and the rest of the party returned to the real world where they had Gilbert brought back from the dead.  Caietano retired from the adventuring life, and Knarx decided to move on to continue his solitary quest.  Aikio&rsquo;s school was auctioned off and purchased by an adventuring wizard named Cael.
</p>

<p>
It is now Rova of the year 4719, and the party feels the call to adventure once more.
