<h1>Important FAQ</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>	Magic Ranged Weapons and Ammunition: When a ranged weapon shares its enhancement bonus with its ammunition, does this count as &ldquo;true&rdquo; enhancement bonus or more like a temporary bonus like greater magic weapon? In other words, does the shared enhancement bonus allow the arrow to bypass damage reduction as if it was cold iron, silver, adamantine, and aligned?
	<dd>	No, other than the ways indicated in the Core Rulebook (if the ranged weapon is at least +1, they count as magic, and if the ranged weapon is aligned they count as that alignment as well) the enhancement bonus granted to ammunition from the ranged weapon doesn&rsquo;t help them overcome the other types of damage reduction. Archers and other such characters can buy various sorts of ammunition or ammunition with a high enhancement bonus to overcome the various types of damage reduction.

	<dt>	Perception: When I use Perception as a move action to search for traps or other secrets, how wide of an area can I search? The <i>Core Rulebook</i> doesn&rsquo;t say, and <i>Pathfinder Unchained</i> mentions a 10 by 10 area, but it&rsquo;s part of an optional consolidated skills subsystem.
	<dd>	As per <i>Ultimate Intrigue</i>, there are two ways Perception checks happen in the game. The first way is automatic and reactive. Certain stimuli automatically call for a Perception check, such as a creature using Stealth (which calls for an opposed Perception check), or the sounds of combat or talking in the distance. The flip side is when a player actively calls for a Perception check because her PC is intentionally searching for something (this is the relevant type of Perception used to find traps, unless you have the trap spotter rogue talent, which makes it reactive). This always takes at least a move action, but often takes significantly longer.

<p>
The core rules don&rsquo;t specify what area a PC can actively search, but for a given Perception check it should be no larger than a 10-foot-by-10-foot area, and often a smaller space if that area is cluttered. For instance, in an intrigue-based game, it is fairly common to look through a filing cabinet full of files. Though the cabinet itself might fill only a 5-foot-by-5-foot area, the number of files present could cause a search to take a particularly long time.

<p>
This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the GM or player needs to roll a Perception check for every 10 foot by 10 foot area, however. It&rsquo;s much smoother to have the GM roll several secret Perception checks for each searching character and then apply each roll only when the PC is searching an area that actually has something to find.

	<dt>	Flight and Magical Flight: Can a paralyzed or stunned creature keep flying with magical flight? Does a creature with magical flight not apply bonuses or penalties to Fly checks because it doesn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; fly speed? Does flying make a creature immune to being flat-footed?
	<dd>	No, any creature that loses all actions can&rsquo;t take an action to attempt a Fly check to hover in place and thus automatically falls. That includes a paralyzed, stunned, or dazed creature. Magical flight doesn&rsquo;t act any differently, even for paralysis, as it isn&rsquo;t a purely mental action. A creature with 0 Dexterity can&rsquo;t fly, and paralysis sets a creature&rsquo;s Dexterity to 0. Despite the fact that the Fly skill mentions that bonuses and penalties from maneuverability apply to creatures with natural fly speeds, they apply for any fly speed. If they didn&rsquo;t apply to creatures that gained flight artificially or through magic, then those maneuverabilities (like the listed good maneuverability for the fly spell) would have no game effect. Finally, the statement &ldquo;You are not considered flat-footed while flying&rdquo; means that flying (unlike balancing using Acrobatics or climbing) doesn&rsquo;t automatically make you flat-footed or force you to lose your Dexterity bonus to AC; it doesn&rsquo;t mean that flying makes you immune to being caught flat-footed.
