<h1>Maptool Basics: Starting a Server</h1>
This is what I do to start a server.  I should warn you that if it doesn&rsquo;t work for you, there&rsquo;s not a lot I can do to help &ndash; this is the part of Maptool I understand the least.  You may find it useful to consult the <a href="http://forums.rptools.net/download/file.php?id=4923&sid=428e4328a8ca86ec9e11ea8f5bd984ea">Networking Help</a> guide that the guys at RPTools wrote, but it isn&rsquo;t super obvious to me.

<p>
Still, Rich, Scott, and I have all managed it, so hopefully it&rsquo;s doable for you, too.

<p>
To start a server, go to the File menu, and click "Start a Server."  You'll get a dialogue that looks something like this:
<br/>

Some of this is pretty opaque to me, but:
<ul>
	<li>	<b>Username</b> is the name you log in as.
	<li>	You can log in as a GM or as a Player to your own server.  You will not need a password for either, because that would be silly.
	<li>	<b>Port</b> is the server port.  The default for Maptool is 51234, so leave that alone.
	<li>	<b>UPnP</b> is a handy feature that your router might have.  Mine is old and does.  Try checking this.  If you don&rsquo;t have UPnP, things get difficult.
</ul>

<p>
Obviously the RPTools.net Alias is the name the server shows up as on the list, GM Password is the password for other people to use if they want to log in as a GM, and Player Password is the password for players to log in with.

<p>
Everything in the Options box you should set to be exactly identical to what I have done.

<p>
Sometimes people can&rsquo;t see the server in the list, so we have to make a direct connection (what Fey calls the back door).  You&rsquo;ll need to provide people with the IP address of your server.  The easiest way to do that is to go to the File menu and pick "Connection Information."  You'll get a little dialogue like so.

<p>
Write down the 10-digit number that appears under <b>External Address</b> and email it to people.  I&rsquo;ve put a little black box over mine out of paranoia, since this is a public website.
