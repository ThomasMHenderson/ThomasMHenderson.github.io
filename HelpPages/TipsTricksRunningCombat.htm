<h1>Tips &amp; Tricks: Running Combat</h1>

I find running combat to be the most stressful part of being a DM.  I don't have a lot of advice here, but here are a few things I find useful:
<ul class=spaced>
	<li>	Insist that the players start their turn by first saying what they're going to do, then using the macros to do it.  It'll take a moment to use the macros, and by having them announce their turn first, you can figure out what you need to do.

	<li>	Don't let people dither too long.  If you tell someone it's their turn and they haven't started typing soon thereafter, don't be afraid to have them delay.

	<li>	While you're waiting on people to take their turn, figure out what you think the monsters should do next.  Sometimes the players will surprise you and you need to change your plans, but often you can plan their turn out ahead of time.

	<li>	As the DM, you should also start <i>your</i> turn by saying what you're going to do, then use the macros to do it.  This avoids problems where it looks like the DM is asleep at the switch.

	<li>	Make sure the players roll initiative at the end of a combat so you don't have to wait for them to do it before combat can start.
</ul>
