<h1>Rules Basics: Combat</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

This page is meant to give a quick overview of what you need to know to run or participate in a combat.  I am going to assume that you already understand the nuts and bolts (hit points, armor class, saving throws, making attack rolls, and so on) and am just going to cover some basic rules elements that people may not have down particularly well.  This is by no means going to be exhaustive.

<p>
A quick but important note: although it doesn&rsquo;t play out like this, combat in Pathfinder is actually representing something very fast-paced.  A single combat round is just six seconds of game time.  Movement in combat isn&rsquo;t people walking slowly and carefully from place to place, it&rsquo;s people jogging or even running to get where they want to be.  Spellcasters are tossing out spells almost as fast as they can incant them.  Archers are loosing arrows at their target at an unbelievable rate.  Swordsmen are raining blows down upon their opponents.

<p>
All of this is just to say that while it may feel like your character didn&rsquo;t get to do very much on your turn when all he did was pull out a potion and drink it, what that actually represents is your character rifling through his pack for the right vial, pulling it out, popping out the cork, and drinking it, all while avoiding swords, arrows, and explosions... and all in the time it took to read this sentence.  I don&rsquo;t think we communicate this very well in our games, but it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to bear it in mind.

<h2 id=StartingCombat>Starting a Combat</h2>
This is a simple summary of how you start combat.  Obviously, <i>someone</i> has to be aware of the existence of his or her opponents before combat can start.  There are two basic scenarios:
<ul style="margin-bottom:0">
	<li>	If every member on one side is unaware of the existence of the other side, that second side can start combat whenever it wants.  Combat begins with a surprise round.
	<li>	If some people on each side are aware of the existence of the other side, combat starts normally.  It starts with a surprise round if any people are caught unaware.
</ul>
Clearly, the key thing is to determine who is aware of whom.


<h3>Determining Awareness</h3>
<ul>
	<li>	Usually, this calls for a Perception check of some sort.
	<li>	If people are talking and someone decides to start a fight, here are the rules I use:
		<ul>
			<li>	The person who wants to start the fight &ndash; the initiator, as I will call them &ndash; rolls a Bluff check.
			<li>	Everyone else rolls a Sense Motive check.
			<li>	People whose Sense Motive beats the initiator&rsquo;s Bluff realize that a fight is about to break out.  Everyone else is surprised.
			<li>	It may be fair to insist that everyone who is not surprised delay until the initiator&rsquo;s turn.
		</ul>
</ul>

<div class=example>
For example, Tonya, Rhud, and Audr are talking to a giant when Tonya decides she&rsquo;d better strike first and decides to cast a fireball.  She rolls a Bluff check, while Rhud, Audr, and the giant all roll Sense Motive checks.  Only the giant and Audr beat Tonya&rsquo;s Bluff.  Combat then begins with a surprise round during which the giant, Audr, and Tonya get to act.  Rhud is caught completely off guard and just watches for the first round.  If Tonya is not first in initiative, the DM might want to ask people to wait until Tonya casts her fireball before taking their turns.
</div>


<h3>Surprise Rounds</h3>
<ul>
	<li>	In a surprise round, only those people who are aware of the combat get to act.
	<li>	In a surprise round you may only take a swift action and a standard action (which you could trade for a move action).
</ul>


<h3>Flat-Footed</h3>
Until you have taken your first turn, you are flat-footed:
<ul>
	<li>	Attacks against you are made against your flat-footed Armor Class.
	<li>	You may not make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed unless you have Combat Reflexes.
	<li>	You may not take an immediate action while flat-footed.
	<li>	Typically you are vulnerable to sneak attack while flat-footed.
</ul>



<hr>
<h2 id=Actions>Types of Actions</h2>
There are a handful of categories into which actions fall:
<ul>
	<li>	Full-round actions.  These basically take up your entire turn.  Common examples include making a full attack, charging, running, withdrawing, or casting a spell with a casting time of 1 round.
	<li>	Standard actions.  Standard actions allow you to do something basic, like making a single attack or casting a spell.
	<li>	Move actions.  Move actions allow you to move up to your speed or to do something that takes an equivalent amount of time, like sheathing or drawing a weapon.
	<li>	Free actions.  Free actions take up basically no time, and you can do as many of them on your turn as you want, subject to DM restrictions on what&rsquo;s reasonable.
	<li>	Swift actions.  Swift actions take up a little more time than free actions.
	<li>	Immediate actions.  Immediate actions are like swift actions, but you can even take them on someone else&rsquo;s turn.
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt">
A few basic rules:
<ul>
	<li>	The only action you can take when it&rsquo;s not your turn is an immediate action.  Otherwise, when it&rsquo;s not your turn you&rsquo;re limited to talking and to taking attacks of opportunity.
	<li>	When it is your turn, you can <i>either</i> take a full-round action <i>or</i> a standard action and a move action.
	<li>	You can always trade your standard action for a move action.
	<li>	You can take <b><i>one</i></b> swift action on your turn.
	<li>	You can take an immediate action whenever you want, even if it&rsquo;s in the middle of someone else&rsquo;s turn.  However, if it <i>is</i> your turn, your immediate action takes the place of your swift action.  If it is not your turn, your immediate action replaces the swift action on your next turn.
</ul>

<p>
You can find examples of various actions <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#table-8-2-actions-in-combat">here</a>.  This table also lists which actions provoke attacks of opportunity and which do not.  I&rsquo;ll go over a few rules for each type of action.


<h3>Full-Round Actions</h3>
There aren't a ton of these you'll use.  Here are the important ones:
<ul>
	<li>	If you intend to make more than one attack with a weapon, you must use a full-round action.
	<li>	Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 round or longer is a full-round action.
	<li>	Other relevant full-round actions include charge, run, and withdraw.
</ul>



<h3>Standard Actions</h3>
Typical standard actions:
<ul>
	<li>	Make a single attack.  Remember that making a ranged attack provokes an attack of opportunity.
	<li>	Cast a single spell.  Remember that casting a spell in melee provokes an attack of opportunity, but you can avoid that by casting defensively.
	<li>	Use a magic item.
	<li>	Take a move action.
</ul>

<p>
A brief word on touch spells: as part of casting a touch spell, you have to touch someone to deliver the spell.  You can cast the spell, and then walk up to someone, and only then touch them or try to do so.


<h3>Move Actions</h3>
There's lots of move actions you might want to take.  Here are several:
<ul style="margin-bottom:0pt">
	<li>	Get out or put away an item.
	<li>	Stand up.
	<li>	Move.
</ul>
This does bring up something I want to point out: you cannot generally just arbitrarily switch weapons in the middle of a fight.  If, for example, you're holding your sword but you want to use your bow, it's a move action to get your bow out and another move action to put your sword away.  You could <i>drop</i> your sword as a free action, get your bow out as a move action, and make a single attack with a standard action, though.

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt">
We pretty much have movement down, but to summarize:
<ul>
	<li>	With a move action you are allowed to move up to your movement speed, perhaps modified by terrain.  This movement provokes an attack of opportunity.
	<li>	If you do not move out of your square on your turn, you can take a 5-foot step.  This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
	<li>	Every second diagonal step you take costs double.
	<li>	You can take a full round action to run, which lets you run four times your speed (three times your speed if heavily encumbered or wearing heavy armor).  This movement must be in a straight line, and while running you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt">
A few notes on things we haven't covered yet:
<ul>
	<li>	Difficult terrain is terrain which hinders your movement.
		<ul>
			<li>	Moving into a square of difficult terrain costs twice as much, so if you only have 5 feet of movement left, you cannot move into a square of difficult terrain.  <b>Note:</b> this means you cannot take a 5-foot step in difficult terrain.
			<li>	Diagonal movement in difficult terrain costs a flat 15 feet of movement but you don't have to worry about the 5-10-5-10 alternation for normal diagonal movement.
		</ul>
	<li>	No matter how hampered your movement is, you can always move 5 feet as a full-round action which provokes an attack of opportunity.
	<li>	Rules for climbing, swimming, and flying are found under the relevant skill.
	<li>	You can only take a 5' step with a particular form of movement if you have a listed speed for that type of movement.  Thus, because Rhud does not have a listed Swim speed, he cannot take a 5' step by swimming.  The giant shark he is fighting is probably not under this limitation.
</ul>

<h2 id=OpportunityAttacks>Attacks of Opportunity</h2>
These are probably the most complicated thing to keep track of.  I refer you back to <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#table-8-2-actions-in-combat">this table</a> to help remember what provokes an AoO and what does not.  The general idea is simple enough, though: anything which distracts you or makes it difficult to properly defend yourself is likely to provoke an AoO.

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt">
A couple of general notes:
<ul>
	<li>	Unless you have some ability that says otherwise, you can only make one AoO per round, and you cannot make an AoO while you are flat-footed.
	<li>	The same action can provoke multiple AoOs if each has a different reason.
	<li>	Moving, however, only provokes one AoO.
	<li>	You can only make an AoO against someone if you threaten them.  Typically, this requires you to be armed and able to reach them.  You count as "armed" if you are using a melee weapon, or a natural weapon (e.g. a claw), or a touch spell that can do damage (e.g. <i>chill touch</i>).  You also count as "armed" if you are just using your fists but you have a gauntlet, Improved Unarmed Strike, or some other way of doing lethal damage.
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt">
Here are the most common things you might do which provoke an AoO:
<ul>
	<li>	If you <b><i>leave</i></b> a square your enemy can attack into, you provoke an AoO.
	<li>	Casting a spell provokes an AoO unless you cast defensively.
	<li>	Making an unarmed attack provokes an AoO unless that attack counts as "armed".
	<li>	Making a ranged attack provokes an AoO.
	<li>	Standing up from prone provokes an AoO.
	<li>	Retrieving stowed gear provokes an AoO (but drawing a weapon does not).
	<li>	Putting gear away also provokes an AoO (including sheathign a weapon).
</ul>

<div class=example>
To give an example: Tonya walks up to a giant intent on delivering her <i>touch of fiery death</i> spell.  The giant has reach, so in order to get close enough to touch the giant, Tonya has to exit a square which the giant threatens.  This provokes an AoO from the giant.  Tonya gets closer and decides to cast <i>scorching ray</i> instead.  Because she foolishly chooses not to cast defensively, this also provokes an AoO.  She finishes the spell and aims it at the giant; this requires making a ranged attack, so this <i>also</i> provokes an AoO.

<p>
Supposing the giant and Tonya both survive, the giant may decide to close with Tonya.  He walks right up to her, slips, and falls.  He decides to stand up.  He provokes an AoO for standing up.  If Tonya is wielding her frying pan, she can make that attack.  Unfortunately, she dropped it earlier and so is unarmed and cannot make AoOs even though the giant provoked one.
</div>

<h2 id=Miscellany>Miscellaneous Rules</h2>
There are a few miscellaneous things I want to mention.


<h3 id=CombatManeuvers>Combat Maneuvers</h3>
We don&rsquo;t use them too often, but you may run into a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#combat-maneuvers" target=_blank>combat maneuver</a>.  If you want to use your whip to sweep your enemy off his feet, this is a trip maneuver and there are rules for that.  If you want to kick your opponent&rsquo;s sword out of his hand, this is a disarm maneuver and there are rules for that.  If you want to throw dirt into your opponent&rsquo;s eyes and blind him, this is a dirty trick maneuver and there are rules for that, too.

<p>
Generically, to succeed on a combat maneuver I roll 1d20 and add my <b>Combat Maneuver Bonus</b> and compare to my opponent&rsquo;s Combat Maneuver Defense.  If I meet or exceed the target, my combat maneuver succeeds.  This is pretty simple, but the devil is in the details and combat maneuvers can be kind of a pain to work out.  Very often, AoOs are involved.

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt">
Therefore, if someone tries a combat maneuver, I go to the relevant pages and read over the rules quickly.  I link them here for convenience:
<ul>
	<li>	If you try to run into someone and knock them backward, this is a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#bull-rush" target=_blank>Bull Rush</a> combat maneuver.
	<li>	Trying to disarm someone of his or her weapon is a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#disarm" target=_blank>Disarm</a> combat maneuver.
	<li>	If you want to impose some temporary penalty on your opponent (e.g. blinding him by throwing sand, or reducing his speed by pulling his pants down),  this is a <a href=http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedPlayersGuide/advancedNewRules.html#dirty-trick target=_blank>Dirty Trick</a> combat maneuver.
	<li>	If you want to drag your enemy behind you as you move  this is a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedPlayersGuide/advancedNewRules.html#drag" target=_blank>Drag</a> combat maneuver.
	<li>	Wrestling is complicated and is covered under the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#grapple" target=_blank>Grapple</a> rules.
	<li>	If you mean to run over someone and knock them prone, moving through their square, this is an <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#overrun" target=_blank>Overrun</a> maneuver.
	<li>	If you want to change which square your opponent is standing in, this is a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedPlayersGuide/advancedNewRules.html#reposition" target=_blank>Reposition</a> combat maneuver.
	<li>	If you want to take an item that your opponent is not holding (e.g. taking a dagger from his belt) this is a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedPlayersGuide/advancedNewRules.html#steal" target=_blank>Steal</a> combat maneuver.
	<li>	If you want to attack and damage an object your opponent is wearing or carrying, this is a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#sunder" target=_blank>Sunder</a> combat maneuver.
	<li>	Finally, if you want to knock your enemy off his feet, this is a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#trip" target=_blank>Trip</a> combat maneuver.
</ul>


<h3 id=Waiting>Delaying and Readied Actions</h3>
If, when your turn comes, you do not want to take your turn yet, you have two options:
<ul>
	<li>	You can <i>delay</i>:
		<ul>
			<li>	You give up your entire turn, which you then take later.  You cannot move, then delay, for example.
			<li>	You can take your turn whenever you want, but you cannot interrupt someone else&rsquo;s turn.
			<li>	When you do take your turn, your initiative for the rest of the combat changes.
		</ul>
	<li>	You can <i>ready a standard action</i>:
		<ul>
			<li>	Readying is itself a standard action, so on your turn before you declare that you will ready an action, you can also take your move and/or swift actions.
			<li>	To ready a standard action, you declare what standard action you intend to take and what will trigger it.  For example, you might ready an action to shoot an arrow at the first person who draws his sword.
			<li>	Your readied action can interrupt someone else&rsquo;s turn and happens before the trigger is resolved.  In our example, if someone starts to draw a sword, your shot is resolved before the opponent pulls his sword out.
			<li>	Again, your initiative is changed for the rest of the combat.
		</ul>
</ul>
