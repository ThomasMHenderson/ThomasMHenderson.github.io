<h1>Tips &amp; Tricks: Setting the DC</h1>

This is a lot easier than you might think.  First of all, some basic benchmarks:
<ul>
	<li>	Something you succeed on even if you roll a 1 is something you can never fail at.
	<li>	Something you succeed on with a 10 is something you can do routinely when not distracted (because you can take 10).
	<li>	Something you succeed on only with a 20 is the hardest possible thing you can do.
	<li>	Something which you cannot succeed on even with a 20 is something you simply cannot do.
</ul>

<p>
For skills, the following table indicates basically what various total bonuses mean:
<table>
<tr>
	<th>	Bonus
	<th>	Level of Training
<tr>
	<td>	+0
	<td>	Untrained
<tr>
	<td>	+5
	<td>	Apprentice
<tr>
	<td>	+10
	<td>	Journeyman
<tr>
	<td>	+15
	<td>	Master
<tr>
	<td>	+20
	<td>	Grand Master
<tr>
	<td>	+25
	<td>	Superhuman
</table>

<p>
Thus, in the real world, the village smith in a small village should have a bonus of perhaps +8.  A typical smith in a city might have a +10; the best smith in the nation might have a +15; the best smith in the world might have a +20.  Obviously, in the fantasy world, characters can be much more skilled than that!

<p>
Along with this table, let's benchmark various difficulties:
<table>
<tr>
	<th>	DC
	<th>	Task
	<th>	Take 10 Training
	<th>	Take 20 Training
<tr>
	<td>	0
	<td>	Very Easy
	<td>	Untrained
	<td>	Untrained
<tr>
	<td>	5
	<td>	Easy
	<td>	Untrained
	<td>	Untrained
<tr>
	<td>	10
	<td>	Average
	<td>	Untrained
	<td>	Untrained
<tr>
	<td>	15
	<td>	Tough
	<td>	Apprentice
	<td>	Untrained
<tr>
	<td>	20
	<td>	Challenging
	<td>	Journeyman
	<td>	Untrained
<tr>
	<td>	25
	<td>	Formidable
	<td>	Master
	<td>	Apprentice
<tr>
	<td>	30
	<td>	Heroic
	<td>	Grand Master
	<td>	Journeyman
<tr>
	<td>	35
	<td>	Incredible
	<td>	Superhuman
	<td>	Master
<tr>
	<td>	40
	<td>	Nearly Impossible
	<td>	Superhuman
	<td>	Grand Master
</table>

<p>
Here's what this table means.  Ask yourself "how well trained would someone have to be to routinely succeed on the task?"  Look under the "Take 10 Training" column, find the appropriate level of training, and read off the DC.  Thus, if you think an experienced journeyman could do something routinely but an apprentice could not, you would set the DC around 20.  If you think even an untrained person could do it routinely, the DC is 10 or less.

<p>
Alternatively, ask yourself "how much training would a person need to even have a chance to succeed on the task?"  Look under the "Take 20 Training" column, find the appropriate level of training, and read off the DC.  Thus, if you think you'd need to be <i>at least</i> a journeyman to have a prayer of success, the DC would be around 30.

<p>
You can fudge things a little from here for other factors.  For example, you might decide a wall would ordinarily require a DC 20 check to climb, but because it has rained recently and the wall is a little slippery, the DC is 22.
