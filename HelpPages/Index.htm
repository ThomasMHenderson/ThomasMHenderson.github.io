<h1>Table of Contents</h1>

I've put together a bunch of webpages to help people deal with DMing.  It's not all finished, but this is the landing page.  I've broken these up into three sections.



<h2>Maptool Basics:</h2>
This describes the basics of using Maptool as a GM.  There's a lot here.  Don't panic.  It won't take long to get a handle on.  But be sure you read all of these before you take over as DM.
<ul>
	<li>	<a href="MaptoolBasicsMaps.htm">		Making Maps		</a>
		<br>
		This describes how to get maps into Maptool and how to handle vision, fog of war, and VBL.

	<li>	<a href="MaptoolBasicsMinis.htm">		Making Minis		</a>
		<br>
		This describes how to make tokens in Maptool.

	<li>	<a href="MaptoolBasicsMaptoolPanels.htm">	Maptool Panels		</a>
		<br>
		This describes how to use the Campaign Panel, the Initiative Panel, and the Map Explorer Panel.  All three will be very useful to you.

	<li>	<a href="MaptoolBasicsMenus.htm">		Menus			</a>
		<br>
		This goes over the menus at the top ("File," "Edit," and so on).

	<li>	<a href="MaptoolBasicsStartingServer.htm">	Starting a Server	</a>
		<br>
		This goes over starting a server.  I should warn you that this is the part I am least able to troubleshoot.

	<li>	<a href="MaptoolBasicsTools.htm">		Tools			</a>
		<br>
		Finally, this goes over the various little icons underneath the menus at the top.  You'll need this to handle VBL and Fog of War properly.
</ul>



<h2>Rules Basics:</h2>
This is an attempt to provide the basic D&amp;D rules you will need in an accessible form.
<ul>
	<li>	<a href="RulesBasicsCombat.htm">		Combat				</a>
		<br>
		This is a long one, but it goes over the very basic rules for what you can and cannot do in combat.  I cover starting a combat, what kind of actions you can take in a combat, attacks of opportunity, and some important miscellaneous rules.

	<li>	<a href="RulesBasicsSkills.htm">		Skill and Ability Checks	</a>
		<br>
		This covers all the important rules for making skill checks and ability checks.

	<li>	<a href="RulesBasicsStatBlocks.htm">		Reading Statblocks		</a>
		<br>
		This works through a couple of examples on reading a monster&rsquo;s stat block.  It&rsquo;s pretty easy, but I figure, might as well be complete.
</ul>



<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
This provides several GMing tips I've learned over the years.
<ul>
	<li>	<a href="TipsTricksAdventurePreparation.htm">	Adventure Preparation	</a>
		<br>
		This describes the prep work I do before we start an adventure.

	<li>	<a href="TipsTricksEncounterCreation.htm">	Encounter Creation	</a>
		<br>
		If you write your own adventure, you'll have to make your own encounters.  If you use a pre-generated adventure, you might want to modify those encounters to reflect the fact that we are five instead of four.  This describes how I do that.

	<li>	<a href="TipsTricksRunningCombat.htm">		Running Combat		</a>
		<br>
		This short little page describes how I run a combat.

	<li>	<a href="TipsTricksSkills.htm">			Setting the DC		</a>
		<br>
		If you want the PCs to face a skill challenge of some kind, you need to decide on the DC of the skill or ability check.  This is advice for how to do that.
</ul>
