<h1>Rules Basics: Skill and Ability Checks</h1>

<p>
Out of combat, most of the mechanics you will need to know are skill checks and ability checks.  They follow the same basic rules, so I'll cover them together, but I'm going to focus on skill checks, which are more common.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Let me start with a couple of general comments:
<ul>
	<li>	Some skills cannot be used without training.  This means that if you have no ranks in that skill, you cannot even attempt a check.  These skills are Disable Device, Handle Animal, Linguistics, Profession, Sleight of Hand, Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device.  Also, you need training in the relevant Knowledge skill to attempt a check with DC higher than 10.
	<li>	The writeup for each skill will tell you whether you can retry a check or not, and it will tell you how long a skill check takes and what kind of action attempting a check uses.  Thus, when someone wants to roll a skill check, it is worth taking a minute to reread the rules for that skill.
</ul>


<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Now, skill and ability checks can be subdivided into two categories: opposed checks and non-opposed checks.
<ul>
	<li>	Opposed checks are when you're trying to pit your ability to do something against someone else's.  For example, arm wrestling could be handled as an opposed Strength check.  Telling a lie is your Bluff check opposed by the other person's Sense Motive check.  Spotting someone in disguise is your Perception check opposed by the other person's Disguise check.
	<li>	If you're not pitting your ability against another person's, it a non-opposed check.  For example, walking a tightrope is an Acrobatics check.  Kicking in a door is a Strength check. Doing first aid is a Heal check.
</ul>


<h2>Opposed Checks</h2>
Mechanically, these are really simple:
<ul>
	<li>	Each person rolls 1d20 and adds his/her bonuses.
	<li>	The person with the higher total wins.
	<li>	If the totals are the same, the person with the higher bonus wins.
	<li>	If the bonuses are also the same, flip a coin to break the tie or something.  I just have people reroll.
</ul>


<div class=example>
<p>
To give an example, Audr and Shannae decide to arm wrestle.  This is an opposed Strength check.  Audr has +5 Str, Shannae has +2.  Audr rolls 1d20+5 and gets a 11.  Shannae rolls 1d20+2 and gets a 14.  Shannae wins, because her roll is higher.

<p>
Audr demands a rematch.  This time she rolls 1d20+5 and gets a 13.  Shannae rolls 1d20+2 and also gets a 13.  Audr wins, because the totals were the same but Audr has a higher bonus.

<p>
Now Rhud decides to step in and arm wrestle Audr.  Rhud has +5 Str, just like Audr.  Both roll 1d20+5 and by coincidence, both get 17.  Since they have the same total and the same bonus, the tie needs to be broken in some way.
</div>


<h2>Non-Opposed Checks</h2>
These are even simpler:
<ul>
	<li>	Roll 1d20 and add your bonuses.
	<li>	If your total meets or exceeds the DC, you succeed.
	<li>	Otherwise, you fail.
	<li>	<b>Important Note:</b> On skill and ability checks, a 1 does not always fail and a 20 does not always succeed.
</ul>

<div class=example>
To give an example, Talaus wants to pick a lock.  The lock is set at DC 25.  Talaus has a +15 to Disable Device, so rolls 1d20+15.  If he gets a 25 or higher, he picks the lock.  If he gets a 24 or lower, he doesn't pick the lock.
</div>


<h2>Aid Another</h2>
In many cases, a person can help you out by choosing to aid another.  To do so, they roll a DC 10 skill check for the relevant skill.  If they succeed, you get a +2 bonus on your roll.

<p>
<b>Important Note:</b> You cannot aid another on a skill check if you are not allowed to make the check.  For example, if you are not trained in Disable Device, you cannot even attempt a Disable Device check.  This means you cannot aid another here, either.


<h2>Taking 10</h2>
When you are not distracted or in immediate danger, you can take 10, which just sets the result of 1d20 to 10.  For example, to jump across a 10' chasm is a DC 10 Acrobatics check, and when not in combat you can take 10 and automatically succeed in the jump (presuming your Acrobatics modifier is at least +0).  In combat, you are in immediate danger so can no longer take 10.  Some characters may have a special ability that lets them take 10 even when they are in danger or distracted, but if a person tries to take 10 in combat, you should ask them what ability lets them do so.


<h2>Taking 20</h2>
In some circumstances you can take 20.  To take 20, you must be able to take 10, the check you are trying to make must allow retries, there must be no consequences for failure, and retrying the check must not increase the difficulty.  If all of these circumstances are met, you can take 20, which treats the 1d20 roll as a 20 but takes 20 times as long.  Again, some characters may have special abilities that let them bypass some or all of these limitations, but again you should ask if someone tries to take 20 and you don't think they're able to do so.  

<p>
Generally taking 20 on opposed checks is not possible.
