<h1>Tips &amp; Tricks: Adventure Preparation</h1>

This is a simplified version of what I do to prepare to run an adventure.  I'm not saying you must do things my way, but it's convenient and not too hard.

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Here are my basic steps:
<ol style="margin-bottom:0">
	<li>	Read the adventure (or your section of it) from beginning to end.
	<li>	Once done, immediately write down a basic outline of what the adventure (or your section of it) entails.
	<li>	Read the adventure (or your section of it) again, this time highlighting anything important.  You should be able to do that directly in the pdf with modern versions of Adobe Reader.  I have Adobe Reader DC, and here's how I highlight text:
		<ul>
			<li>	I open the pdf, obviously.
			<li>	I click on the "Tools" panel.
			<li>	I find the thing marked "Comment" and I click on it.
			<li>	I now have a menu bar near the top of the window.  The second thing from the left on the "Comment" menu bar is the highlighter tool.  I click that.
			<li>	Now I can go to the text I want to highlight, hold down the left mouse button, and drag the cursor over the text I want to highlight, letting the mouse button back up when I want to stop highlighting.
			<li>	When I'm done, I save.
		</ul>
		While you're reading and highlighting, you should also write down a list of which maps you will need and which minis you will need.
	<li>	Now I <a href="MaptoolBasicsMaps.htm" target=_blank>make the maps</a> and <a href="MaptoolBasicsMinis.htm" target=_blank>make the minis</a>.
</ol>
And that's all I think you <i>have</i> to do.  I like to take the time before we start for the night to reread the part of the adventure I think we're likely to do that night.


<p style="margin-bottom:0">
There are, though, some things I think you <i>should</i> do.
<ol style="margin-bottom:0">
	<li>	Place notes directly on the maptool map.
	<li>	Write down basic information about each monster the PCs are going to face.
	<li>	Make an NPC roster.
</ol>
I'll go over each of these things.  I have added several pictures here.  You can left-click on most of them to open up a bigger version where you can see more clearly.


<hr>
<h2>Placing Notes on the Map</h2>
The first thing you should do is drag a token onto the map, ideally one which is obviously going to be used for notes.  I use this one:
<div class=imgwrap>
<img src="Scroll.png" style="width:185px"/>
</div>

<p>
Now if I double-click on the token, a little window calling itself "Edit Token" pops up.  This window has a bunch of tabs, the leftmost of which is "Notes."  Go to the Notes tab and you can type things into the Notes section.  If you then press OK when you're done, the notes you typed in will be saved.
<div class=imgwrap>
<a href="./TakingNotes.jpg" target=_blank><img src="./TakingNotes.jpg" style="width:185px; border:2px #8C7054 solid"/></a>
</div>

<p>
Now drag the token to where you want it to be on the map.  Right click on it.  Go to "Change To" and select "Hidden." 
<div class=imgwrap>
<a href="./ChangeTo.jpg" target=_blank><img src="./ChangeTo.jpg" style="width:185px"/></a>
</div>

<p>
Now that the token is safely on the hidden layer, the players won't be able to see it.  But you can click on the token and its notes will pop up for you to see!

<h2>Writing Down Monster Information</h2>
I like to be able to reference information about the monsters the party is fighting.  So for each monster, I make a little text file and I write down several pieces of pertinent information:
<ul style="margin-bottom:0">
	<li>	<b>Source:</b> the url from which I took the monster
	<li>	<b>Senses:</b> any unusual senses the monster has, plus its Perception bonus
	<li>	<b>Languages:</b> any languages the monster speaks in case the party wants to talk to it
	<li>	<b>HP, AC, Saves, Move, Attacks:</b> the token will have this, but I like to record it so I can spot any discrepancies if I get suspicious
	<li>	<b>Special:</b> any other special abilities the monster has.  If I don't know how those abilities work, I write that down, too.
</ul>
By keeping this kind of information handy, I can spend a minute or two looking over the monster before the party fights it and hopefully have a good idea of what it can do.


<p>
Here is a sample to get the idea across:
<div style="margin-left:50px">
<table>
<caption>Wight</caption>
<tr>
	<th>	Source:
	<td>	http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/bestiary/wight.html
<tr>
	<th>	Senses:
	<td>	darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +11
<tr>
	<th>	Languages:
	<td>	Common
<tr>
	<th>	AC:
	<td>	15, touch 11, flat-footed 14
<tr>
	<th>	HP:
	<td>	26
<tr>
	<th>	Saves:
	<td>	Fort +3, Ref +2, Will +5
<tr>
	<th>	Defenses:
	<td>	Undead Traits
<tr>
	<th>	Weaknesses:
	<td>	Resurrection Vulnerability
<tr>
	<th>	Speed:
	<td>	30 ft.
<tr>
	<th>	Melee Attack:
	<td>	Slam +4 (1d4+1 plus energy drain)
<tr>
	<th>	Ranged Attack:
	<td>	&mdash;
<tr>
	<th>	Special Attack:
	<td>	Create Spawn, Energy Drain (1 level, DC 14)
</table>

<dl>
	<dt>	Create Spawn (Su)
	<dd>	A humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds.  The spawn is under the command of the wight that created it.  It takes a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks and has -2 hp per HD.

	<dt>	Energy Drain (Su)
	<dd>	Each attack inflicts a negative level on the target, and the wight gains 5 hp.  Negative levels last 24 hours or until removed by a spell.  If not removed before 24 hours have passed, the target must make a DC 14 Fort save or the negative level becomes permanent.  A separate save is required for each negative level.

	<dt>	Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
	<dd>	A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.

	<dt>	Undead Traits
	<dd>	Immune to mind-affecting effects, bleed, death effects, disease, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, stunning, nonlethal damage, ability drain, energy drain, ability damage to Str/Con/Dex, exhaustion, and fatigue.  Immune to any effect requiring a Fort save unless the effect works on objects or is harmless.
</dl>
</div>
You might notice that the bestiary entry I linked to doesn't spell out what energy drain or undead traits are.  But that's because it's cross-referenced, and you can click on those things to find out what they mean.  Rather than doing that, I would rather just write them down.

<h2>Making an NPC Roster</h2>
I like having a little NPC roster which I can refer back to whenever the party encounters an NPC I'm not already familiar with.  To make an NPC roster, I just open up a text file and for each NPC I write down basic information about them: notes on appearance, personality, role in the adventure.  For example, if the PCs from Jade Regent were NPCs in my game, I might have something like this:

<div style="margin-left:20pt">
<dl>
	<dt>	Audr
	<dd>	<ul>
			<li>	Audr is tall and buxom, with honey-brown hair she wears in braids.
			<li>	She is fierce and loves to fight, but also enjoys carousing and making merry.
			<li>	Audr is the party fighter.
		</ul>

	<dt>	Hieronymous
	<dd>	<ul>
			<li>	Hieronymous is of average height and weight, with black hair and blue eyes.
			<li>	Hieronymous used to be a cynical drunkard, but he has grown into a compassionate sort.
			<li>	Hieronymous is the party healer.
		</ul>

	<dt>	Shannae
	<dd>	<ul>
			<li>	Shannae is tall and slender, with black hair and purple eyes.
			<li>	She is inquisitive and irresponsible, but well-meaning.
			<li>	Shannae is the party archer and provides buffing abilities.
		</ul>

	<dt>	Talaus
	<dd>	<ul>
			<li>	Talaus is tall, with silver hair, and blue eyes.
			<li>	Talaus is gung-ho and does not suffer fools gladly.
			<li>	He is one of the party blasters and also handles locks and traps.
		</ul>

	<dt>	Tonya
	<dd>	<ul>
			<li>	Tonya is short and beautiful, and wears skimpy clothes.
			<li>	She is simple but well-meaning.
			<li>	Tonya blows things up and also helps heal people.
		</ul>
</dl>
